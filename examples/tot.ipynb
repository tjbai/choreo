      "ANSWER: To solve the problem, we count the total number of ways to choose 3 knights out of 25, which is $\\binom{25}{3} = 2300$, and then count the number of ways to choose 3 knights where at least two of them are sitting next to each other. We find that there are 25 ways to choose two knights who are sitting next to each other and then choose the third knight from the remaining knights, and 25 ways to choose three knights who are all sitting next to each other. However, we have overcounted by 25, so the total number of ways to choose 3 knights where at least two of them are sitting next to each other is 50. Therefore, the probability $P$ is $\\frac{50}{\\binom{25}{3}} = \\frac{50}{2300} = \\frac{1}{46}$. The sum of the numerator and denominator is $1+46 = \\boxed{47}$.\n",
