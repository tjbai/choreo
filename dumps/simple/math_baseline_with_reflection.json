To find the equation of the line, I should have used the point-slope form of a line, which is $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line. Let's use the point $(7, 4)$ to find the equation of the line. The slope is $m = 1$, so the equation of the line is $y - 4 = 1(x - 7)$. Simplifying the equation, we get $y - 4 = x - 7$. Adding $4$ to both sides, we get $y = x - 3$. To find the $x$-intercept, we set $y = 0$ and solve for $x$. Plugging in $y = 0$ into the equation $y = x - 3$, we get $0 = x - 3$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 3$. However, this is the same answer I got previously, and upon reevaluating my work, I realize that the correct equation of the line is actually $y - 4 = 1(x - 7)$ which simplifies to $y - 4 = x - 7$ which can be further simplified to $y = x - 3$.

The problem statement only says that one vertex of the triangle is on the vertex of the parabola, and the opposite side lies along the line y = k. This means that the line y = k is actually a horizontal line that intersects the parabola at a point other than the vertex. Let's call the x-coordinate of this point x_k. Then, the y-coordinate of this point is k = x_k^2 - 8x_k + 5. Since the point (x_k, k) is a vertex of the equilateral triangle, the distance between this point and the vertex of the parabola (4, -11) is equal to the distance between the other two vertices of the triangle. Let's call the distance between the other two vertices d. Then, we have sqrt((x_k - 4)^2 + (k + 11)^2) = d. Since the triangle is equilateral, we know that d = sqrt(3) * |x_k - 4|. Equating the two expressions for d, we get sqrt((x_k - 4)^2 + (k + 11)^2) = sqrt(3) * |x_k - 4|. Squaring both sides and simplifying, we get (x_k - 4)^2 + (k + 11)^2 = 3(x_k - 4)^2. Expanding and simplifying, we get k^2 + 22k + 121 = 2(x_k - 4)^2. Since k = x_k^2 - 8x_k + 5, we can substitute this expression for k into the equation above to get x_k^4 - 16x_k^3 + 69x_k^2 - 96x_k + 45 = 2(x_k - 4)^2. Simplifying and rearranging, we get x_k^4 - 16x_k^3 + 67x_k^2 - 80x_k + 17 = 0. This is a quartic equation in x_k, and it is difficult to solve analytically. However, we can try to find a rational root using the Rational Root Theorem. The theorem states that if p/q is a rational root of the polynomial, then p must be a factor of the constant term, and q must be a factor of the leading coefficient. In this case, the constant term is 17, and the leading coefficient is 1, so the possible rational roots are \u00b11, \u00b117. We can try each of these values to see if it is a root of the polynomial. After some trial and error, we find that x_k = 1 is a root of the polynomial.

However, since the problem is given in parametric form, it is more convenient to use the chain rule and the fact that $x$ is a function of $t$ to find the derivative of $y$ with respect to $t$, and then set it equal to zero.

In fact, the points being coplanar means that these vectors are linearly dependent, but not necessarily in a way that can be easily expressed as a linear combination of the other two vectors.

The correct height is the difference between the y-coordinate of point A and the y-coordinate of point B, which is 9 units. But, to get the height of the triangle, we need to consider the vertical distance from point A to line BC. Since line BC is on the x-axis, the height of the triangle is simply the y-coordinate of point A, which is 9 units. The base of the triangle is still 12 units. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is A = (12 * 9) / 2 = 54 square units. However, this is not the correct answer. The correct answer should be the area of the triangle, which is the product of the base and the height divided by 2. The height of the triangle is 9 units, and the base is 12 units.

To get a sum of 3 or more, at least one of the dice must be a 1, and the other two dice can be any number from 1 to 6.

The solution was overly complicated and didn't provide a clear and concise path to the answer.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can take a simpler approach. We know that the slope of the tangent line to the parabola at point T is -2a. We can use this information to find the equation of the tangent line.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line can be written as y - (9 - a^2) = -2a(x - a). We can simplify this equation to y = -2ax + (9 - a^2).\n\nWe can use the point-slope form of a line to find the equation of the tangent line. The point-slope form of a line is y - y1 = m(x - x1), where m is the slope and (x1, y1) is a point on the line.\n\nIn this case, the slope of the tangent line is -2a and the point T is (a, 9 - a^2). We can plug these values into the point-slope form of a line to get y - (9 - a^2) = -2a(x - a).\n\nWe can simplify this equation to y = -2ax + (9 - a^2).\n\nNext, we need to find the x-intercept and y-intercept of the tangent line. To find the x-intercept, we set y = 0 and solve for x. This gives us x = (9 - a^2) / (2a).\n\nTo find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y. This gives us y = 9 - a^2.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line and the coordinate axes. The formula for the area of a triangle is A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercept and the y-intercept, which is (9 - a^2) / (2a) - 0 = (9 - a^2) / (2a). The height of the triangle is the distance between the y-intercept and the origin, which is 9 - a^2.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is A = (1/2)((9 - a^2) / (2a))(9 - a^2) = (9 - a^2)^2 / (4a).\n\nWe are given that the area of the triangle is 25, so we can set up the equation (9 - a^2)^2 / (4a) = 25. We can simplify this equation to (9 - a^2)^2 = 100a.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get 9 - a^2 = \u00b110\u221aa. Since a is a positive rational number, we know that a^2 is non-negative, so we can add a^2 to both sides of the equation to get 9 = a^2 \u00b1 10\u221aa.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get 81 = a^4 \u00b1 20a\u221aa + a^2. We can rewrite this equation as a^4 - 20a\u221aa + a^2 - 81 = 0.\n\nWe can solve this equation using the quadratic formula. Let x = a\u221aa.

Let's calculate the differences between consecutive terms: x_{2} - x_{1} = 375 - 211 = 164, x_{3} - x_{2} = 420 - 375 = 45, x_{4} - x_{3} = 523 - 420 = 103, x_{5} - x_{4} = 167 - 523 = -356, x_{6} - x_{5} = -91 - 167 = -258, x_{7} - x_{6} = -55 - (-91) = 36, x_{8} - x_{7} = -402 - (-55) = -347, x_{9} - x_{8} = -433 - (-402) = -31, x_{10} - x_{9} = -771 - (-433) = -338. The differences between consecutive terms do not seem to have a simple pattern. However, we can observe that the sequence of differences has a certain property: the difference between two consecutive terms in the sequence of differences is equal to the difference between the corresponding terms in the original sequence. For example, (x_{3} - x_{2}) - (x_{2} - x_{1}) = (420 - 375) - (375 - 211) = 45 - 164 = -119, which is equal to (x_{4} - x_{3}) - (x_{3} - x_{2}) = (523 - 420) - (420 - 375) = 103 - 45 = 58, but also (x_{4} - x_{3}) - (x_{3} - x_{2}) = 103 - 45, and (x_{5} - x_{4}) - (x_{4} - x_{3}) = -356 - 103 = -459, which is equal to (x_{6} - x_{5}) - (x_{5} - x_{4}) = -258 - (-356) = 98, but also (x_{6} - x_{5}) - (x_{5} - x_{4}) = -258 - (-356), and so on. This property suggests that the sequence of differences may be periodic, but with a period that is not necessarily 5. To find the correct period, we need to continue calculating the differences between consecutive terms and look for a repeating pattern. Unfortunately, I do not have enough information to determine the correct period of the sequence of differences. Therefore, I cannot provide a correct solution to the problem. However, I can suggest a possible approach to find the correct solution: continue calculating the differences between consecutive terms and look for a repeating pattern in the sequence of differences. Once the correct period is found, we can use it to find the values of x_{531}, x_{753}, and x_{975} and add them up to get the final answer.

By substituting $y = frac{5 - 2x}{3}$ into the expression $frac{3}{x} + frac{2}{y}$, we get $frac{3}{x} + frac{2}{frac{5 - 2x}{3}} = frac{9}{5 - 2x}$.

The inequality states that the quadratic mean of a set of nonnegative real numbers is greater than or equal to their arithmetic mean, but it does not directly apply to the expression $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2$. A better approach is to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(1 + 1 + 1 + 1) ge (a + b + c + d)^2$. Since $a + b + c + d = 1$, we have $(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)(4) ge 1$, which implies $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ge frac{1}{4}$. However, this is not the minimum value. To find the minimum value, we need to find the values of $a, b, c, d$ that satisfy the equality condition of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The equality condition is satisfied when $a = b = c = d = frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is $a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = (frac{1}{4})^2 + (frac{1}{4})^2 + (frac{1}{4})^2 + (frac{1}{4})^2 = frac{1}{16} + frac{1}{16} + frac{1}{16} + frac{1}{16} = frac{4}{16} = frac{1}{4}$.

To see this, we can simply observe that the graph of xy = k is a hyperbola with branches in the first and third quadrants when k > 0, and a hyperbola with branches in the second and fourth quadrants when k < 0. The graph of x^2 + y^2 = k^2 is a circle centered at the origin with radius k. When k \u2265 0, the circle and hyperbola intersect at the points (k, 0) and (-k, 0). When k < 0, the circle and hyperbola do not intersect. Therefore, the number of integer values of k for which the graphs do not intersect is 0.", "Answer": {"count": 0}}, {"Reasoning": "Upon reviewing my previous solution, I realize that I made a mistake in evaluating the function f(x) = 3^x.

Therefore, the correct evaluation is that f(x) = 3^x is an even function because it satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x).", "Answer": "even"}, {"Reasoning": "Upon reviewing my previous solution, I realize that I made a mistake in solving the equation. I multiplied both sides by $2x$, but I should have been more careful. The correct step is to multiply both sides by $2x$ to get $6x^3 + 1 = 6x$. Then, I can rearrange the equation to get $6x^3 - 6x + 1 = 0$. This is a cubic equation, and it's not immediately clear how to solve it. However, we can notice that the equation can be factored as $(2x-1)(3x^2+2x+1) = 0$. The quadratic factor $3x^2+2x+1$ has no real roots, so the only real solution to the equation is $x = frac{1}{2}$. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it into the given expression $64x^6 + frac{1}{729x^6}$. Since $x = frac{1}{2}$, we can substitute this value to get $64left(frac{1}{2}right)^6 + frac{1}{729left(frac{1}{2}right)^6}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $frac{64}{64} + frac{64}{64} = 2$.

The correct factorization is $(x - 2)^4 - (x - 2) = (x - 2)((x - 2)^3 - 1) = (x - 2)((x - 2) - 1)((x - 2)^2 + (x - 2) + 1) = 0$. However, this is not the only way to factor the polynomial. Another possible factorization is $(x - 2)^4 - (x - 2) = (x - 2)^3(x - 2) - (x - 2) = (x - 2)^2((x - 2)^2 - 1) = 0$. Therefore, the roots of the first polynomial are $x = 2, x = 1, x = 2 + \\sqrt{2}, x = 2 - \\sqrt{2}$ is incorrect, instead, the roots are $x = 2, x = 1, x = \\sqrt{2}, x = -\\sqrt{2}$, Next, we need to find the roots of the second polynomial. Let's substitute the roots of the first polynomial into the second polynomial $x^2 - kx + k = 0$ to find the value of $k$. We have $2^2 - k(2) + k = 0 \\implies 4 - 2k + k = 0 \\implies -k = -4 \\implies k = 4$ is still a valid solution, but it's not the only solution. We also have $1^2 - k(1) + k = 0 \\implies 1 - k + k = 0 \\implies 0 = 0$, which is true for any value of $k$. Therefore, the second polynomial has $k = 4$ as a solution, but it also has infinitely many other solutions. However, we are given that the two polynomials have exactly two roots in common. Therefore, the other root must be either $x = \\sqrt{2}$ or $x = -\\sqrt{2}$. Let's substitute these values into the second polynomial to find the value of $k$. We have $(\\sqrt{2})^2 - k(\\sqrt{2}) + k = 0 \\implies 2 - k\\sqrt{2} + k = 0 \\implies k\\sqrt{2} - k = -2 \\implies k(\\sqrt{2} - 1) = -2 \\implies k = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} \\implies k = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} + 1}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\implies k = \\frac{-2(\\sqrt{2} + 1)}{2 - 1} \\implies k = -2(\\sqrt{2} + 1) \\implies k = -2\\sqrt{2} - 2$. Similarly, we have $(-\\sqrt{2})^2 - k(-\\sqrt{2}) + k = 0 \\implies 2 + k\\sqrt{2} + k = 0 \\implies k\\sqrt{2} + k = -2 \\implies k(\\sqrt{2} + 1) = -2 \\implies k = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\implies k = \\frac{-2}{\\sqrt{2} + 1} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2} - 1}{\\sqrt{2} - 1} \\implies k = \\frac{-2(\\sqrt{2} - 1)}{2 - 1} \\implies k = -2(\\sqrt{2} - 1) \\implies k = -2\\sqrt{2} + 2$. However, we are given that the two polynomials have exactly two roots in common, and we already found $k = 4$ as one solution. Therefore, the other solution must be either $k = -2\\sqrt{2} - 2$ or $k = -2\\sqrt{2} + 2$. However, we also need to check if $k = 4$ is the only solution for $x = \\sqrt{2}$ or $x = -\\sqrt{2}$.
