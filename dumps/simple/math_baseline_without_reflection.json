We can use the slope-intercept form of a line, which is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. The slope of the line can be found using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are the coordinates of the two points. In this case, we have $(x_1, y_1) = (7, 4)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (6, 3)$, so the slope is $m = \frac{3 - 4}{6 - 7} = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1$.

Since together they have $35, we can set up the equation L + M = 35. We are also given that Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount, which can be written as L = (2/5)M. We can substitute this expression for L into the first equation to solve for M. Substituting L = (2/5)M into L + M = 35, we get (2/5)M + M = 35. Combining like terms, we get (7/5)M = 35. To solve for M, we can multiply both sides by the reciprocal of (7/5), which is (5/7). Multiplying both sides by (5/7), we get M = 35 * (5/7) = 25. Therefore, Lenny has $25. Since Larry has two-fifths of Lenny's amount, we can calculate Larry's amount by multiplying Lenny's amount by (2/5). Larry's amount is 25 * (2/5) = 10.

However, we are working in base 7, so we need to convert 12 to base 7. 12 in base 10 is equal to 15 in base 7, so we have $6 + 6 = 15$ in base 7. Since $A + B$ is 15 in base 7, we can write $A + B = 15_7$. Since we are working in base 7, we can write $A + B$ as $A + B = (1 \times 7^1) + (1 \times 7^0) = 7 + 1 = 8$. Since $A + B$ is 8 in base 10, we can write $A + B = 8$. Therefore, the sum of $A$ and $B$ is 8. Since $A + B$ is 8, we can write $A + B = 8$. Now, let's look at the next column. We see that $A + 1 = A$, which means that $A + 1$ is a multiple of 7. Since $A$ is 6, we have $6 + 1 = 7$, which is a multiple of 7. Therefore, the values of $A$ and $B$ are $A = 6$ and $B = 6$. Now that we have the values of $A$ and $B$, we can find the product of the digits represented by $A$ and $B$. The product of $A$ and $B$ is $6 \times 6 = 36$.

We know that the slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative of the parabola at point T. The derivative of the parabola y = 9 - x^2 is y' = -2x. So, the slope of the tangent line at point T is -2a.\n\nThe equation of the tangent line can be written as y - (9 - a^2) = -2a(x - a). We can simplify this equation to y = -2ax + (9 - a^2).\n\nNext, we need to find the x-intercept and y-intercept of the tangent line. To find the x-intercept, we set y = 0 and solve for x. This gives us x = (9 - a^2) / (2a). To find the y-intercept, we set x = 0 and solve for y. This gives us y = 9 - a^2.\n\nNow, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the area of the triangle formed by the tangent line and the coordinate axes. The formula for the area of a triangle is A = (1/2)bh, where b is the base of the triangle and h is the height of the triangle.\n\nIn this case, the base of the triangle is the distance between the x-intercept and the y-intercept, which is (9 - a^2) / (2a) - 0 = (9 - a^2) / (2a). The height of the triangle is the distance between the y-intercept and the origin, which is 9 - a^2.\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is A = (1/2)((9 - a^2) / (2a))(9 - a^2) = (9 - a^2)^2 / (4a).\n\nWe are given that the area of the triangle is 25, so we can set up the equation (9 - a^2)^2 / (4a) = 25. We can simplify this equation to (9 - a^2)^2 = 100a.\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get 9 - a^2 = \u00b110\u221aa. Since a is a positive rational number, we know that a^2 is non-negative, so we can add a^2 to both sides of the equation to get 9 = a^2 \u00b1 10\u221aa.\n\nSince a is a rational number, we know that a^2 is an integer, so we can write a^2 = m^2 for some integer m. Substituting this into the equation, we get 9 = m^2 \u00b1 10\u221aa.\n\nSquaring both sides of the equation, we get 81 = m^4 + 100a \u00b1 20m^2\u221aa. Since m^2 is an integer, we know that m^4 is also an integer, so we can write m^4 = n^4 for some integer n.\n\nSubstituting this into the equation, we get 81 = n^4 + 100a \u00b1 20m^2\u221aa. We can rewrite this equation as n^4 + 100a = 81 \u00b1 20m^2\u221aa.\n\nWe know that a is a positive rational number, so we can write a = p/q for some positive integers p and q. Substituting this into the equation, we get n^4 + 100p/q = 81 \u00b1 20m^2\u221a(p/q).\n\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by q^4, we get n^4q^4 + 100p^4 = 81q^4 \u00b1 20m^2p^2q^2\u221a(p/q).\n\nSince p/q is a rational number, we know that \u221a(p/q) is a rational number, so we can write \u221a(p/q) = r/s for some integers r and s. Substituting this into the equation, we get n^4q^4 + 100p^4 = 81q^4 \u00b1 20m^2p^2q^2r/s.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as n^4q^4 + 100p^4 = (81q^4 \u00b1 20m^2p^2q^2r/s)q^2.

Substituting this into the equation, we get m^4q^4 + 100p^4 = (81q^4 \u00b1 20m^2p^2qr/s)q^2.\n\nWe can rewrite this equation as m^4q^4 + 100p^4 = (81q^4 \u00b1 20m^2p^2qr/s)q^2 = (81 \u00b1 20m^2p^2qr/s)q^4.\n\nWe know that m^4 is an integer, so we can write m^4 = n^4 for some integer n.

Comparing the two forms, we can see that the center of the ellipse is at (-3, -1) and the length of the semi-major axis is [sqrt{19}.] The length of the major axis is twice the length of the semi-major axis, so the length of the major axis is [2sqrt{19}.]", "Answer": "2\u221a19"}, {"Answer": "\": \"odd\""}, {"Answer": "\": \"4 \\u221a155\""}, "{\"Reasoning\": \"To solve the given sum, we first need to simplify the expression inside the summation.

Expanding the expressions for $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, we get \\begin{align*}\np(x) &= (x^2 + kx + 1)^2 \\\\\n&= x^4 + 2kx^3 + (k^2 + 2)x^2 + 2kx + 1,\n\\end{align*}and \\begin{align*}\nq(x) &= (x^2 + lx + 1)^2 \\\\\n&= x^4 + 2lx^3 + (l^2 + 2)x^2 + 2lx + 1.\n\\end{align*}Comparing the coefficients of $x^3$, $x^2$, $x$, and the constant terms in $p(x)$ and $q(x)$, we obtain the following system of equations: \\begin{align*}\na &= 2k, \\\\\nb &= k^2 + 2, \\\\\nc &= 2k, \\\\\n2a &= 2l, \\\\\n2b &= l^2 + 2, \\\\\n2c &= 2l.\n\\end{align*}Since $a = 2k$, we have $l = a$. Substituting $l = a$ into the third and sixth equations, we get $c = 2k$ and $2c = 2a$, which implies $c = a$. Substituting $l = a$ into the second equation, we get $2b = a^2 + 2$. Solving for $b$, we obtain $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$. Substituting $c = a$ into the fifth equation, we get $2b = a^2 + 2$. Solving for $b$, we obtain $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$. Therefore, we have $a = c$ and $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$. Since $a = c$, we have $a^2 = c^2$. Substituting $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$ into the first equation, we get $a = 2k$. Since $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$, we have $2b = a^2 + 2$. Substituting $a = 2k$ into the equation $2b = a^2 + 2$, we get $2b = (2k)^2 + 2$. Simplifying, we obtain $2b = 4k^2 + 2$. Dividing both sides by $2$, we get $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Substituting $a = 2k$ into the equation $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$, we get $b = \\frac{(2k)^2 + 2}{2}$. Simplifying, we obtain $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Since $b = 2k^2 + 1$ and $b = 2k^2 + 1$, we have $a = c = 2k$. Since $a = c = 2k$, we have $a^2 = c^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$. Substituting $a^2 = 4k^2$ into the equation $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$, we get $b = \\frac{4k^2 + 2}{2}$. Simplifying, we obtain $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Since $b = 2k^2 + 1$, we have $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Substituting $b = 2k^2 + 1$ into the equation $a = 2k$, we get $a = 2k$. Since $a = 2k$, we have $a = 2k$. Substituting $a = 2k$ into the equation $c = 2k$, we get $c = 2k$. Therefore, we have $a = c = 2k$. Substituting $a = 2k$ into the equation $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$, we get $b = \\frac{(2k)^2 + 2}{2}$. Simplifying, we obtain $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Since $b = 2k^2 + 1$, we have $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Since $a = c = 2k$ and $b = 2k^2 + 1$, we have $a + b + c = 2k + 2k^2 + 1 + 2k$. Simplifying, we obtain $a + b + c = 4k + 2k^2 + 1$. Since $a = c = 2k$, we have $a^2 = c^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$. Substituting $a^2 = 4k^2$ into the equation $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$, we get $b = \\frac{4k^2 + 2}{2}$. Simplifying, we obtain $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Therefore, we have $a + b + c = 4k + 2k^2 + 1$ and $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Since $a = c = 2k$, we have $a^2 = c^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$. Substituting $a^2 = 4k^2$ into the equation $b = \\frac{a^2 + 2}{2}$, we get $b = \\frac{4k^2 + 2}{2}$. Simplifying, we obtain $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Therefore, we have $a + b + c = 4k + 2k^2 + 1$ and $b = 2k^2 + 1$. Since $a = c = 2k$, we have $a^2 = c^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2$.

We can start by analyzing the equations and looking for any relationships between them. The equation x^2 + y^2 = k^2 represents a circle with radius k, centered at the origin. The equation xy = k represents a hyperbola. To find the values of k for which the graphs do not intersect, we need to find the values of k for which the circle and hyperbola do not have any common points. We can do this by finding the values of k for which the circle and hyperbola are disjoint. We can start by solving the system of equations x^2 + y^2 = k^2 and xy = k. We can do this by substituting y = k/x into the first equation, which gives us x^2 + (k/x)^2 = k^2. We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by x^2, which gives us x^4 + k^2 = k^2x^2. We can rearrange this equation to get x^4 - k^2x^2 + k^2 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in x^2, so we can solve it using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula gives us x^2 = (k^2 \u00b1 \u221a(k^4 - 4k^2)) / 2. We can simplify this expression by factoring out a k^2, which gives us x^2 = (k^2 \u00b1 \u221a(k^2(k^2 - 4))) / 2. We can further simplify this expression by factoring out a k^2, which gives us x^2 = (k^2 \u00b1 k\u221a(k^2 - 4)) / 2. We can now consider the two cases: when k^2 - 4 \u2265 0 and when k^2 - 4 < 0. When k^2 - 4 \u2265 0, we have x^2 = (k^2 \u00b1 k\u221a(k^2 - 4)) / 2. We can see that x^2 is real and positive, so x is real.

When k < \u221a4, we have y = 2 / (k \u00b1 \u221a(k^2 - 4)). We can see that y is real, so the graphs of x^2 + y^2 = k^2 and xy = k intersect. Therefore, the graphs of x^2 + y^2 = k^2 and xy = k do not intersect when k < \u221a4. The values of k for which the graphs do not intersect are k = 1, 2, 3. Therefore, the number of integer values of k for which the graphs do not intersect is 3.", "Answer": {"count": 3}}, {"Reasoning": "To determine whether the function f(x) = 3^x is even, odd, or neither, we need to check if it satisfies the conditions of even and odd functions. An even function satisfies the condition f(-x) = f(x) for all x in its domain, while an odd function satisfies the condition f(-x) = -f(x) for all x in its domain. In this case, let's substitute -x into the function f(x) = 3^x and see what we get. f(-x) = 3^(-x) = 1/3^x = 1/f(x). This result does not satisfy the condition for an even function f(-x) = f(x), nor does it satisfy the condition for an odd function f(-x) = -f(x).

This gives us $6x^2 - 3 + 1 = 0$, which simplifies to $6x^2 - 2 = 0$. We can then solve for $x^2$ by adding 2 to both sides, giving us $6x^2 = 2$. Dividing both sides by 6, we get $x^2 = frac{1}{3}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we find that $x = pm sqrt{frac{1}{3}}$. Now that we have the value of $x$, we can substitute it into the given expression $64x^6 + frac{1}{729x^6}$. Since $x^2 = frac{1}{3}$, we can substitute this value to get $64left(frac{1}{3}right)^3 + frac{1}{729left(frac{1}{3}right)^3}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $frac{64}{27} + frac{1}{2187}$. Combining the fractions, we have $frac{64}{27} + frac{1}{2187} = frac{64cdot 81}{27cdot 81} + frac{1}{2187} = frac{5184}{2187} + frac{1}{2187} = frac{5185}{2187}$.
