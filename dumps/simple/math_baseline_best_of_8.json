Substituting $x=r$ into the equation, we get \\[r^2 - (q+p)r = r^2 - (q+p)r.\\]This is true for all values of $r$, so we can conclude that the equation is an identity and that any value of $x$ will satisfy it. However, we are asked to find the other solution in terms of $p$, $q$, and $r$. To find the other solution, we can use the fact that the equation is a quadratic equation and that the product of its roots is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient. The constant term is $pq$ and the leading coefficient is $1$, so the product of the roots is $pq$. Since we know that one of the roots is $r$, the other root must be $p$ or $q$, depending on which one is greater. Therefore, the other solution is $x=p$ or $x=q$. However, we need to determine which one is the correct solution. We can do this by substituting $x=p$ and $x=q$ into the original equation and checking which one satisfies it. Substituting $x=p$, we get \\[(p-p)(p-q) = (r-p)(r-q)\\]which simplifies to \\[0 = (r-p)(r-q)\\]Since $r\\neq p$ and $r\\neq q$, we can conclude that $x=p$ is not a solution to the equation.

Simplifying, we get: AB^2 = 9 + 289. AB^2 = 298. Taking the square root of both sides, we get: AB = sqrt(298). AB \u2248 17.29. Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse AB, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: A = (1/2)bh. We know that the base of the triangle is BC, which is equal to 20. We also know that the height of the triangle is AD, which is equal to 3. Substituting these values into the formula, we get: A = (1/2)(20)(3). A = 30. Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is approximately 30 square units.", "Answer": 30}, {"Answer": "\": \"660/7\""}, {"Reasoning": "To solve this problem, we can use the concept of right triangles and the relationship between the tangent of an angle and the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. We are given that $tan angle CAB = frac{22}{7}$, which means that the ratio of the length of the side opposite $angle CAB$ to the length of the side adjacent to $angle CAB$ is $frac{22}{7}$. We are also given that the altitude from $A$ divides $overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$. Let's call the length of the side adjacent to $angle CAB$ as $x$ and the length of the side opposite $angle CAB$ as $22y$, where $y$ is a positive real number. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse $AC$ as $sqrt{x^2 + (22y)^2}$. We know that the altitude from $A$ divides $overline{BC}$ into segments of length $3$ and $17$, so the length of the altitude is $frac{3cdot17}{3+17} = frac{51}{20}$. Using the similarity of triangles, we can set up a proportion to relate the lengths of the sides of the two triangles: $frac{22y}{x} = frac{3}{17}$. Solving for $y$ in terms of $x$, we get $y = frac{3x}{17cdot22}$. Substituting this expression for $y$ into the equation for the length of the hypotenuse $AC$, we get $AC = sqrt{x^2 + (22cdotfrac{3x}{17cdot22})^2} = sqrt{x^2 + frac{9x^2}{289}} = sqrt{frac{298x^2}{289}} = frac{sqrt{298}x}{17}$. We can now use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is given by $A = frac{1}{2}bh$, where $b$ is the base and $h$ is the height. In this case, the base of the triangle is $BC = 3 + 17 = 20$ and the height is the length of the altitude from $A$, which is $frac{51}{20}$. Plugging in these values, we get $A = frac{1}{2}cdot20cdotfrac{51}{20} = frac{51}{2}$.

We'll call the vertex angle C, and the altitudes intersecting on the incircle as BD and CE. Since the altitudes are concurrent, we can call the point of intersection O. Let's denote the inradius of the triangle as r. We can also denote the lengths of the altitudes BD and CE as h_B and h_C respectively. Since the triangle is isosceles, we know that BD = CE = h. Now, let's draw the incircle of the triangle, and denote the points where the incircle touches the sides of the triangle as D, E, and F. We can denote the lengths of the segments BF, CF, and AF as x, y, and z respectively. Since the incircle is tangent to the sides of the triangle, we know that the segments BD, CE, and BF are perpendicular to each other. Similarly, the segments CE, AF, and CF are perpendicular to each other. Using the Pythagorean theorem on the right triangles BFD and CEF, we get h^2 + x^2 = r^2 and h^2 + y^2 = r^2 respectively. Subtracting these equations, we get x^2 - y^2 = 0, which means x = y. Now, let's draw the line through C and parallel to the side AB. This line intersects the side AB at a point, which we'll call G. We can denote the length of the segment CG as l. Since the line CG is parallel to AB, we know that the angles CAG and CGB are congruent. Therefore, the triangle CAG is similar to the triangle CGB.

The quadratic formula is given by [x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.]In this case, (a = -1,) (b = -1,) and (c = -1.)

Since the left-hand side is a real number, the right-hand side must also be a real number. Therefore, we must have that -1 - cos x is a real number, which implies that cos x is a real number. This is a contradiction, so we cannot have that sin^2 x + cos x = -1.\n\nHowever, we can find the values of x that satisfy the equation sin^2 x + cos x = -1 by using the identity sin^2 x = 1 - cos^2 x.

Since sin^2(x) + 1 = (sin(x) + 1)(sin(x) - 1), we can rewrite the equation as (sin(x) + 1)(sin(x) - 1) = -cos(x). We can then rearrange the terms again to get sin(x) - 1 = -cos(x) / (sin(x) + 1). Now, we can square both sides of the equation to get sin^2(x) - 2sin(x) + 1 = cos^2(x) / (sin(x) + 1)^2. Since sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1, we can rewrite the equation as -2sin(x) + 1 = 1 / (sin(x) + 1)^2. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by (sin(x) + 1)^2 to get -2sin(x)(sin(x) + 1)^2 + (sin(x) + 1)^2 = 1. Expanding the left-hand side of the equation, we get -2sin^3(x) - 2sin^2(x) + (sin(x) + 1)^2 = 1. We can then expand the right-hand side of the equation to get -2sin^3(x) - 2sin^2(x) + sin^2(x) + 2sin(x) + 1 = 1. Combining like terms, we get -2sin^3(x) - sin^2(x) + 2sin(x) = 0. We can then factor out a -sin(x) from the left-hand side of the equation to get -sin(x)(2sin^2(x) + sin(x) + 2) = 0. Setting each factor equal to 0, we get -sin(x) = 0 or 2sin^2(x) + sin(x) + 2 = 0.

First, we are given the perimeter of the triangle, which is the sum of the lengths of its sides. We can set up an equation using this information: (3a-1) + (a^2 + 1) + (a^2 + 2) = 16. We can simplify this equation by combining like terms: 3a + 2a^2 + 3 = 16. Next, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms with the variable: 2a^2 + 3a = 13. Now, we can rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation: 2a^2 + 3a - 13 = 0. We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring or using the quadratic formula. In this case, we will use the quadratic formula: a = (-b \u00b1 \u221a(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a. The coefficients of the quadratic equation are a = 2, b = 3, and c = -13. We can plug these values into the quadratic formula: a = (-(3) \u00b1 \u221a((3)^2 - 4(2)(-13))) / (2(2)). Simplifying this expression, we get: a = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a(9 + 104)) / 4. a = (-3 \u00b1 \u221a113) / 4. The quadratic formula gives us two possible values for a, but we need to choose the value that makes sense in the context of the problem. Since the sides of the triangle are lengths, they must be positive, and the perimeter is 16 units, which means that the sum of the lengths of the sides must be greater than 16. We can check the possible values of a to see which one satisfies this condition. Let's try a = (-3 + \u221a113) / 4. Plugging this value into the expression for the length of the first side, we get: 3a - 1 = 3((-3 + \u221a113) / 4) - 1. Simplifying this expression, we get: 3((-3 + \u221a113) / 4) - 1 = (-9 + 3\u221a113) / 4 - 1. = (-9 + 3\u221a113) / 4 - 4/4. = (-9 + 3\u221a113 - 4) / 4. = (-13 + 3\u221a113) / 4. Since the length of the first side must be positive, we know that (-13 + 3\u221a113) / 4 > 0. We can check this inequality by plugging in the value of \u221a113 \u2248 10.63. (-13 + 3(10.63)) / 4 \u2248 (-13 + 31.89) / 4 \u2248 18.89 / 4 \u2248 4.72. Since 4.72 > 0, we can conclude that a = (-3 + \u221a113) / 4 is a valid solution. Now that we have the value of a, we can find the lengths of the other two sides of the triangle: a^2 + 1 = ((-3 + \u221a113) / 4)^2 + 1. = ((-3 + \u221a113)^2) / 16 + 1. = (9 - 6\u221a113 + 113) / 16 + 1. = (122 - 6\u221a113) / 16 + 16/16. = (122 - 6\u221a113 + 16) / 16. = (138 - 6\u221a113) / 16. a^2 + 2 = ((-3 + \u221a113) / 4)^2 + 2. = ((-3 + \u221a113)^2) / 16 + 2. = (9 - 6\u221a113 + 113) / 16 + 32/16. = (141 - 6\u221a113) / 16.

The bases of the trapezoid are the two parallel sides of the trapezoid. The length of the shorter base is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is 2 meters. The length of the longer base can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let's call the length of the longer base 'b'. We can draw a right triangle with the height of the trapezoid as the height of the triangle, the radius of the semicircle as the hypotenuse, and half of the longer base as the base of the triangle. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the longer base: (b/2)^2 + 1^2 = 1^2. Simplifying, we get b^2/4 + 1 = 1. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get b^2/4 = 0.

We can find the height by dropping a perpendicular from the midpoint of AB to the line CD. Let's call this point E. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the two legs AE and BE are congruent. Therefore, the midpoint of AB is the midpoint of the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs AE and BE. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of AE. Let's call the length of AE x. Then, the length of BE is also x. Since the hypotenuse has a length of 1, we can write the equation: x^2 + x^2 = 1^2. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x^2 = 1. Solving for x, we get: x = sqrt(1/2).

A perfect cube is the cube of an integer, and we are looking for a five-digit number with an 8 in the ten-thousands place. This means the number is of the form 80,xxx. We can express the number as 8 * 10,000 + x, where x is a four-digit number. To find the perfect cube, we need to find an integer y such that y^3 is equal to 8 * 10,000 + x. Since 8 * 10,000 = 80,000, we can rewrite the equation as y^3 = 80,000 + x. We can start by finding the cube root of 80,000, which is between 9 and 10. The cube root of 80,000 is approximately 9.97. This means y must be an integer between 9 and 10. We can test the values of y = 9 and y = 10 to see if they satisfy the equation y^3 = 80,000 + x. If y = 9, then 9^3 = 729, which is less than 80,000.

Since we are looking for four consecutive even integers, the next three integers can be represented as x+2, x+4, and x+6. The sum of these four integers is given by the expression x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6). This simplifies to 4x + 12. Since we are told that the sum is a perfect square, we can set 4x + 12 equal to a perfect square, say n^2, where n is an integer. This gives us the equation 4x + 12 = n^2. We can rewrite this equation as 4x = n^2 - 12. To find the least possible sum, we need to find the smallest possible value of x. Since x must be a positive even integer, we can start by trying x = 2. Substituting x = 2 into the equation 4x = n^2 - 12, we get 4(2) = n^2 - 12, which simplifies to 8 = n^2 - 12. Adding 12 to both sides, we get n^2 = 20. Since n^2 = 20 is not a perfect square, x = 2 is not a valid solution. Next, we try x = 4. Substituting x = 4 into the equation 4x = n^2 - 12, we get 4(4) = n^2 - 12, which simplifies to 16 = n^2 - 12. Adding 12 to both sides, we get n^2 = 28.

Substituting x = 6 into the equation 4x = n^2 - 12, we get 4(6) = n^2 - 12, which simplifies to 24 = n^2 - 12. Adding 12 to both sides, we get n^2 = 36. Since n^2 = 36 is a perfect square, x = 6 is a valid solution. We can now find the sum of the four consecutive even integers: x + (x+2) + (x+4) + (x+6) = 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 = 36.

The new spinner will have the numbers 1, 2, and 5. John will spin this spinner, and the process continues. The game will last for three more spins, as the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. After the third spin, the game will be over, as there are no factors of 5. The total number of spins is 1 (initial spin) + 3 (spins after the first spin) = 4 spins. However, we can further analyze the factors of the numbers on the spinner to see if there are any other scenarios where the game can last longer.\n\nIf John spins a 5 on the new spinner, the game will last for two more spins, as the factors of 5 are 1 and 5. After the second spin, the game will be over, as there are no factors of 5. The total number of spins is 1 (initial spin) + 2 (spins after the first spin) = 3 spins. We can see that this scenario results in a lower number of spins than the previous scenario. Therefore, the scenario where John spins a 10 on the new spinner is the optimal scenario.\n\nIn conclusion, the maximum number of total spins John can make before the game is over is 4 spins. This is because the scenario where John spins a 10 on the new spinner results in the longest game duration.

The game is over when the spinner has no numbers on it. This means that Gary's list of factors must eventually be reduced to zero. We can start by finding the factors of 20: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20. These will be the numbers on Gary's spinner. Since John spins a 20 on his first spin, we can start with Gary's list: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10. John spins this list and gets a 5. Gary then creates a new list of factors of 5: 1 and 5. John spins this list and gets a 1. Gary then creates a new list of factors of 1: 1. John spins this list and gets a 1. Gary then creates a new list of factors of 1: 1. At this point, Gary's list is empty, and the game is over.

We need to continue this process until the spinner has no numbers on it, which means that the new spinner created in each step will have only one number left, and the game will end.

The ant is moving on a hexagon, which means it has 6 adjacent vertices. After each step, the ant can move to any of the 6 vertices. Since the ant starts at a specific vertex, we can consider this as a random walk on a hexagonal lattice. The key insight here is that the ant's movement is a Markov chain, where the probability of moving to a particular vertex only depends on the current vertex and not on any previous vertices. The probability of returning to the starting vertex after $n$ steps can be calculated using the formula for the number of self-avoiding walks on a hexagonal lattice. However, this problem can be simplified by considering the symmetry of the hexagon and the fact that the ant can only move to adjacent vertices. The ant will return to the starting vertex if it has an even number of steps that are not adjacent to the starting vertex. Since the ant has 15 steps, it will return to the starting vertex if it has 7 or 9 steps that are not adjacent to the starting vertex. The probability of this occurring can be calculated using the binomial distribution. We can use the binomial coefficient to count the number of ways the ant can have 7 or 9 non-adjacent steps out of 15, and then divide by the total number of possible paths to get the probability. The probability of the ant having 7 non-adjacent steps is $ {15 choose 7} cdot left(frac{1}{6}right)^7 cdot left(frac{5}{6}right)^8 $, and the probability of the ant having 9 non-adjacent steps is $ {15 choose 9} cdot left(frac{1}{6}right)^9 cdot left(frac{5}{6}right)^6 $. The probability that the ant returns to the starting vertex is the sum of these two probabilities. Therefore, the probability that the ant is standing on the same vertex on which he began is $ {15 choose 7} cdot left(frac{1}{6}right)^7 cdot left(frac{5}{6}right)^8 + {15 choose 9} cdot left(frac{1}{6}right)^9 cdot left(frac{5}{6}right)^6 $", "Answer": "0.1643"}, {"Reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that the ant is standing on the same vertex on which he began after 15 steps.

Let's calculate the number of possible paths of length 15 that return to the starting vertex. We can represent the path as a sequence of 15 letters, each of which is one of the 6 directions. Since the ant returns to the starting vertex, the sequence must have an equal number of letters representing the 3 directions that move the ant to the right and the 3 directions that move the ant to the left. The number of such sequences is equal to the number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 15 for the letters representing the directions that move the ant to the right. This can be calculated as 15 choose 3, which is equal to 455.

This is because each clockwise turn is equivalent to a step in one direction, and each counterclockwise turn is equivalent to a step in the opposite direction. Since the ant starts and ends at the same vertex, the number of clockwise and counterclockwise turns must be equal. The probability of this happening can be calculated using the formula for the probability of a random walk returning to the starting point, which is 1/(2^(n-1)), where n is the number of steps. In this case, n = 15, so the probability is 1/(2^(15-1)) = 1/1024.

To account for this, we need to consider the possible paths the ant can take after 15 steps.

However, since the ant can only make integer numbers of turns, we need to round k to the nearest integer. In this case, k = 7 or k = 8.

A closed walk is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex. The number of closed walks of length 15 on the hexagon can be calculated using the formula for the number of closed walks on a graph, which is given by the formula $|E|^k$, where $|E|$ is the number of edges in the graph and $k$ is the length of the walk. In this case, the hexagon has 6 edges, so the number of closed walks of length 15 is $6^{15}$. However, not all of these walks start and end at the same vertex.

The first number in the sequence represents the direction of the first move, the second number represents the direction of the second move, and so on. Since the ant starts at a vertex, the first move must be 0, and the sequence must be a permutation of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, there are 15! permutations of the sequence, and we need to count the number of permutations that end at the starting vertex. A permutation ends at the starting vertex if and only if it contains the same number of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s. Therefore, we can count the number of permutations that end at the starting vertex by counting the number of permutations of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that contain the same number of 0s, 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s, and 5s.

The probability of rolling (4,3) is (4/21) * (3/21) = 12/441. The probability of rolling (5,2) is (5/21) * (2/21) = 10/441. The probability of rolling (6,1) is (6/21) * (1/21) = 6/441. The total probability of rolling a total of 7 is 6/441 + 10/441 + 12/441 + 12/441 + 10/441 + 6/441 = 56/441.

Let's start by using the ratio of the size of the math team to the size of the basketball team to the size of the soccer team, which is $4:3:2$. We can let $x$ be the common multiplier, so the number of students on the math team is $4x$, the number of students on the basketball team is $3x$, and the number of students on the soccer team is $2x$. We are given that half the students play basketball, so the number of students on the basketball team is $60/2=30$, which means $3x=30$ and $x=10$. Therefore, the number of students on the math team is $4x=40$, the number of students on the basketball team is $3x=30$, and the number of students on the soccer team is $2x=20$. Since 8 students play all three sports, we can subtract them from each team to find the number of students who play exactly two sports. The number of students who play only basketball and math is $30-8=22$, the number of students who play only basketball and soccer is $30-8=22$, the number of students who play only math and soccer is $40-8=32$, and the number of students who play only math and soccer is $32-8=24$. However, we are asked for the number of students who play on exactly two teams. This includes the students who play only basketball and math, only basketball and soccer, and only math and soccer. Therefore, the number of students who play on exactly two teams is $22+22+32=\boxed{76}$", "Answer": "76"}, {"Reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of students who play on exactly two teams. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. Let's denote the number of students who play basketball as B, the number of students who play soccer as S, and the number of students who play mathletics as M. We are given that half the students play basketball, so B = 30.\n2. We are also given that the ratio of the size of the math team to the size of the basketball team to the size of the soccer team is 4:3:2. Let's express the number of students in each team as a multiple of this ratio. We can write M = 4x, B = 3x, and S = 2x for some positive integer x.\n3. We know that 8 students play all three sports, so the number of students who play only basketball is B - 8, the number of students who play only soccer is S - 8, and the number of students who play only mathletics is M - 8.\n4. We are given that all 60 students play on at least one of the three teams. This means that the total number of students who play on at least one team is the sum of the students who play only one team, the students who play only two teams, and the students who play all three teams. We can express this as an equation:\n\n(B - 8) + (S - 8) + (M - 8) + 2x + 8 = 60\n\n5. Simplifying the equation, we get B + S + M - 24 + 2x = 60. Substituting the values of B, S, and M from step 2, we get 3x + 2x + 4x - 24 + 2x = 60. Combining like terms, we get 11x - 24 = 60.\n6. Adding 24 to both sides of the equation, we get 11x = 84.\n7. Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 84 / 11 = 8.\n8. Now that we have the value of x, we can find the number of students who play on exactly two teams. The number of students who play on exactly two teams is 2x, since each student plays two teams.

Notice that the term xy(1 - x) is maximized when x = 1, and the term yz(1 - z) is maximized when z = 1.\n\nHowever, we cannot have both x = 1 and z = 1, since that would make y = 0, and the function would be zero.

Since $frac{z_1}{z_2}$ is real, we have $frac{a}{c} = frac{b}{d}$, or $ad = bc$. We also know that $|z_1| = |z_2| = 1$, so $a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2$. Since $ac - bd = 0$, we have $ad = bc$. Since $ad = bc$, we have $c = frac{ad}{b}$ and $d = frac{bc}{a}$. Substituting these into $a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2$, we get $a^2 + b^2 = left(frac{ad}{b}right)^2 + left(frac{bc}{a}right)^2 = frac{a^2d^2}{b^2} + frac{b^2c^2}{a^2} = frac{a^2d^2 + b^2c^2}{a^2b^2}$.

Therefore, we have $a^2 + b^2 = c^2 + d^2$, $ac - bd = 0$, and $ad = bc$. We now have a system of equations with three unknowns $a, b, c$. We can solve this system of equations by expressing $a, b, c$ in terms of a single variable $t$. Let $a = cos t$ and $b = sin t$. Then $c = frac{ad}{b} = frac{cos t sin t}{sin t} = cos t$ and $d = frac{bc}{a} = frac{sin t cos t}{cos t} = sin t$. Therefore, we have $a = cos t$, $b = sin t$, $c = cos t$, and $d = sin t$. We can now substitute these expressions for $a, b, c, d$ into $z_1 z_2 = (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)i$.

Next, we add $px$ to both sides to get $-qxy+px+3y=-3$. Then, we add $3$ to both sides to get $-qxy+px+3y+3=0$. We then add $3$ to both sides to get $-qxy+px+3y+3=0$. We can then factor out $-qy$ from the first two terms to get $-qy(x-p)+3y+3=0$. We can then add $qy(p)$ to both sides to get $-qy(x-p)+qy(p)+3y+3=0$.

We can do this by switching x and y in the equation and solving for y. The equation becomes x = (-py - 3)/(-qy + 3). We can now solve for y by cross-multiplying to get x(-qy + 3) = -py - 3. Expanding and rearranging, we get -qx + 3x = -py - 3, which simplifies to -qx + 3x = -py - 3. We can now isolate y by adding py to both sides and dividing by -q, which gives us y = (-qx + 3x + 3)/p. We can now simplify the expression by combining like terms to get y = (3x - qx + 3)/p, which simplifies to y = (3 - qx)/p. This is the inverse function g(x). We can now substitute x = 7 and y = -22 into the equation to get -22 = (3 - 7q)/p. We can now solve for q by multiplying both sides by p to get -22p = 3 - 7q.

Expanding and rearranging, we get 154q - 66 = -7p - 3, which simplifies to 154q - 66 = -7p - 3. We can now isolate p by adding 7p to both sides and adding 66 to both sides, which gives us 154q + 63 = 7p. We can now solve for p by dividing both sides by 7 to get p = (154q + 63)/7. We can now substitute the expression for q into the equation for p to get p = (154((3 + 22p)/7) + 63)/7. We can now simplify the expression by multiplying 154 by 3 and dividing by 7 to get p = (462 + 462p)/7. We can now multiply both sides by 7 to get 7p = 462 + 462p. We can now isolate p by subtracting 462p from both sides and dividing by -455, which gives us p = -462/455. We can now simplify the expression by dividing both numerator and denominator by 7 to get p = -66/65. We can now substitute the expression for p into the equation for q to get q = (3 + 22(-66/65))/7.

The vertex of the parabola is $(4,-5)$, which means the equation of the parabola can be written in vertex form as $y=a(x-4)^2-5$. This equation tells us that the parabola is a horizontal translation of the graph of $y=ax^2$ by $4$ units to the right and $5$ units downward. The parabola has two $x$-intercepts, one positive and one negative, which means the graph of the parabola must intersect the $x$-axis at two points. Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(4,-5)$, we know that the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the vertical line $x=4$. This means that the two $x$-intercepts of the parabola must be equidistant from the axis of symmetry. Therefore, the two $x$-intercepts of the parabola must have the same $x$-coordinate, but opposite signs. Since the parabola is a horizontal translation of the graph of $y=ax^2$, the two $x$-intercepts of the parabola must also have the same $y$-coordinate, which is $0$. This means that the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y=a(x-r)^2$, where $r$ is the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercepts. Since the two $x$-intercepts have the same $x$-coordinate, we know that $r=4$. Therefore, the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y=a(x-4)^2$. To find the value of $a$, we can use the fact that the parabola has a vertex at $(4,-5)$. This means that the equation of the parabola must satisfy the equation $-5=a(4-4)^2$, which simplifies to $-5=0$. Since this equation is not true, we must have made an error in our previous steps. Let's go back and re-examine our previous steps. We know that the parabola has a vertex at $(4,-5)$ and two $x$-intercepts, one positive and one negative. This means that the parabola must intersect the $x$-axis at two points, one with a positive $x$-coordinate and one with a negative $x$-coordinate. Since the vertex of the parabola is at $(4,-5)$, we know that the axis of symmetry of the parabola is the vertical line $x=4$.

Since the parabola is a horizontal translation of the graph of $y=ax^2$, the two $x$-intercepts of the parabola must also have the same $y$-coordinate, which is $0$. This means that the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y=a(x-r)^2$, where $r$ is the $x$-coordinate of the $x$-intercepts. Since the two $x$-intercepts have the same $x$-coordinate, we know that $r$ must be a real number. Since the parabola is a horizontal translation of the graph of $y=ax^2$, we know that the equation of the parabola can be written in the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola. Therefore, we can write the equation of the parabola as $y=a(x-4)^2-5$. This equation tells us that the parabola is a horizontal translation of the graph of $y=ax^2$ by $4$ units to the right and $5$ units downward. To find the value of $a$, we can use the fact that the parabola has a positive $x$-intercept. This means that the equation of the parabola must satisfy the equation $0=a(x-4)^2-5$ for some positive value of $x$.

The x-intercepts are the values of x where y = 0, so we can substitute y = 0 into the equation and solve for x.  This gives us 0 = a(x-4)^2 - 5, which we can rewrite as a(x-4)^2 = 5.  Since the x-intercepts are positive and negative, the value of (x-4)^2 must be positive, so a must be positive.  Since the parabola opens upwards, the value of a must be positive.  The coefficient c is the constant term in the equation, which is -5, so c must be negative.  The coefficient b can be found by expanding the equation y = a(x-4)^2 - 5, which gives us y = a(x^2-8x+16) - 5.  Expanding this further, we get y = ax^2 - 8ax + 16a - 5.

Plugging in the values of h and k, we get y = a(x - 4)^2 - 5. We are also given that the parabola has two x-intercepts, one positive and one negative. This means that the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, and we can use this information to determine the value of a. Since the parabola intersects the x-axis at two points, the equation y = 0 has two solutions. We can substitute y = 0 into the equation y = a(x - 4)^2 - 5 and solve for x.

To find the x-intercepts, we set y = 0 and solve for x. This gives us 0 = a(x - 4)^2 - 5. We can rewrite this as a(x - 4)^2 = 5. Since a must be positive, we can take the square root of both sides to get sqrt(a)(x - 4) = sqrt(5). Now, we can solve for x by adding 4 to both sides, which gives us sqrt(a)x = sqrt(5) + 4. Finally, we can divide both sides by sqrt(a) to get x = (sqrt(5) + 4)/sqrt(a). Since a must be positive, we can take the reciprocal of both sides to get 1/a = (sqrt(a)/sqrt(5) + 4/sqrt(a))^2.

The equation x^2 + y^2 = k^2 represents a circle centered at the origin with radius k. We want to find the values of k for which the circle and the hyperbola do not intersect. To do this, we can try to find the values of k for which the circle is entirely inside the hyperbola or entirely outside the hyperbola.

For the hyperbola xy = k, the asymptotes have equations y = 0 and x = 0. Therefore, the distance between the origin and the asymptotes is equal to the distance between the origin and the point (0,0), which is 0. This means that the circle will be entirely inside the hyperbola when the radius of the circle is less than 0, and entirely outside the hyperbola when the radius of the circle is greater than 0. However, since the radius of the circle is always non-negative, the circle will always be entirely outside the hyperbola. Therefore, the two graphs will never intersect.
