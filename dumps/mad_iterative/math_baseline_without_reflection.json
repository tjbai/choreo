The volume of a rectangular pool can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and depth. In this case, the length is 12 m, the width is 6 m, and the depth is 4 m. Therefore, the total volume of the pool is 12 * 6 * 4 = 288 cubic meters. Since the pool is half full, we need to divide the total volume by 2 to find the volume of water in the pool. 288 / 2 = 144 cubic meters. Therefore, the volume of water in the pool is 144 cubic meters.", "Answer": "144"}, "{\"Reasoning\": \"To find the value of tan(C), we first need to find the value of sin(B) and cos(C). Given that cos(B) = 6/10, we can find sin(B) using the Pythagorean identity sin^2(B) + cos^2(B) = 1. Therefore, sin(B) = sqrt(1 - cos^2(B)) = sqrt(1 - (6/10)^2) = sqrt(1 - 36/100) = sqrt(64/100) = 8/10.\n\nNext, we need to find cos(C). We can use the fact that cos(C) = adjacent side / hypotenuse. In this case, the adjacent side is the side opposite angle B, which is 6 units long, and the hypotenuse is the side opposite angle C, which is 10 units long. Therefore, cos(C) = 6/10.\n\nNow that we have sin(B) and cos(C), we can find tan(C) using the formula tan(C) = sin(B) / cos(C). Therefore, tan(C) = (8/10) / (6/10) = 8/6 = 4/3.\", \"Answer\": {\"numerator\": 4, \"denominator\": 3}}", {"Reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to use the unit circle and the definition of the tangent function.

We can plug these values into the formula and solve for h.", "Answer": {"num": 10, "den": 1}}, {"Reasoning": "Since $triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we have $mangle ABC=mangle ACB$. Because the sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^circ$, we have $mangle ABC+mangle ACB+mangle BAC=180^circ$. We know that $mangle BAC=40^circ$. Therefore, $mangle ABC+mangle ACB=180^circ-40^circ=140^circ$. Since $triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we have $mangle ABC=mangle ACB$. Therefore, we have $2mangle ABC=140^circ$. Dividing both sides by $2$ yields $mangle ABC=70^circ$. Since $triangle ABC$ is isosceles, we have $mangle BAC=mangle ABC$. Therefore, we have $mangle BAC=70^circ$. Since $mangle BAC+mangle ABC+mangle ACB=180^circ$, we have $70^circ+mangle ACB=180^circ$. Therefore, $mangle ACB=110^circ$. Since $mangle ABC=mangle ACB$, we have $mangle ABC=110^circ$. Therefore, we have $x=180^circ-110^circ=70^circ$. Thus, the number of degrees in angle $x$ is $70^circ$. ", "Answer": "70"}]
