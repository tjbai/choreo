# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the mean is always greater than or equal to the smallest element in the dataset (in this case, the quiz grades).
2. Determine the minimum number of students that can have the same highest grade, allowing the rest to have any lower grade.
3. Calculate the maximum number of students that can exceed the mean by considering the minimum number of students with the highest grade.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the mean is the sum of all grades divided by the number of students, so if the mean is M, the sum of all grades is 107M.
2. Consider the scenario where all but one student have the same high grade, and the remaining student has a grade just below the mean.
3. Realize that in this scenario, no student can exceed the mean, so the maximum number of students who can be awarded extra credit is achieved when all students have the same grade.
4. Determine the maximum number of students who can have the same high grade without exceeding the total sum of grades 107M.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

4. Explore the implications of the mean being the lowest possible score (i.e., the lowest possible mean).
5. Determine the maximum number of students who can score above this minimum mean.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the mean of the 107 quiz grades is a fixed value, and the number of students awarded extra credit is maximized when as many students as possible exceed this mean.

3. Consider that the maximum number of students awarded extra credit is achieved when the minimum score is just below the mean, allowing as many students as possible to be just above the mean.
4. Realize that the largest number of students who can be awarded extra credit is therefore 106, as all but one student can potentially exceed the mean.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the mean is always greater than or equal to the smallest element in a dataset.

2. **Count the number of license plates with no palindromes**: Consider the three-letter arrangement. There are $26$ choices for the first letter, $26$ choices for the second letter, and $25$ choices for the third letter (since it can't be the same as the first letter). Similarly, there are $10$ choices for the first digit, $10$ choices for the second digit, and $9$ choices for the third digit (since it can't be the same as the first digit).

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the equation structure**: Note that the equation is in the form $a^b = 1$, where $a = x^2-4x+2$ and $b = x^2-5x+2$.
2. **Identify conditions for $a$ and $b$**: Recognize that $a$ and $b$ must be real numbers, and that $b$ must be an integer since it's an exponent.
3. **Consider cases for $a$ and $b$**: Break down the problem into cases where $a = 1$, $a = -1$, $a = 0$, and $b = 0$, and other possibilities for $b$ being an integer.
4. **Solve each case**: Use algebraic manipulations and number theory to find the solutions for each case.
5. **Sum the solutions**: Combine the solutions from each case to find the final answer.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the exponent**: We need to find values of $x$ that make the expression $(x^2-4x+2)^{x^2-5x+2}$ equal to 1. Since the base can be any real number, the exponent must be 0 or the base must be 1 or -1.
2. **Solve for exponent being 0**: Set the exponent $x^2-5x+2$ equal to 0 and solve for $x$.
3. **Solve for base being 1 or -1**: Set the base $x^2-4x+2$ equal to 1 or -1 and solve for $x$.
4. **Consider the cases separately**: Analyze each case from steps 2 and 3 separately to find the valid values of $x$.
5. **Sum the valid values**: Add up all the valid values of $x$ obtained from step 4 to get the final answer.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the exponent**: We can focus on the expression $x^2-5x+2$ and consider the cases when it equals 0, 1, or -1, as these are the only values that would result in the entire expression equating to 1.
2. **Examine the base**: We should also consider when $x^2-4x+2$ equals 1, as this would result in a power of 1, which is also equal to 1.
3. **Consider additional cases**: We may need to examine other special cases, such as when the exponent is 0 or when the base is 1 or -1, to ensure we have considered all possibilities.
4. **Solve for x**: Once we have identified the relevant cases, we can solve for the values of $x$ that satisfy the conditions.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the exponent**: Recognize that the expression $(x^2-4x+2)^{x^2-5x+2}$ equals 1 if the exponent is 0 or if the base is 1 (since any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1, and 1 raised to any power is 1).

3. **Solve the exponent equals 0 case**: Set $x^2-5x+2=0$ and solve for $x$.

5. **Combine the solutions**: Sum all the distinct real solutions obtained in the previous steps.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the exponent**: Since the base is not necessarily 1, we focus on the exponent $x^2-5x+2$ to determine when the entire expression equals 1.
2. **Consider cases for the exponent**: Break down the problem into cases based on the value of the exponent, such as when it equals 0, a positive integer, or a negative integer.
3. **Solve for the exponent equal to 0**: Set the exponent $x^2-5x+2$ equal to 0 and solve for $x$.
4. **Solve for the exponent equal to a positive integer**: Use properties of exponents to determine when the base raised to a positive integer power equals 1.
5. **Solve for the exponent equal to a negative integer**: Use properties of exponents to determine when the base raised to a negative integer power equals 1.
6. **Combine solutions**: Combine the solutions from the previous steps to obtain the final set of real numbers $x$ satisfying the given equation.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. **Identify conditions for the exponent to be zero**: The base $x^2-4x+2$ raised to the power of $x^2-5x+2$ equals 1 if the exponent $x^2-5x+2$ is 0, because any non-zero number raised to the power of 0 is 1.
2. **Solve the quadratic equation for the exponent to be zero**: Set the exponent $x^2-5x+2$ equal to 0 and solve for $x$ using standard quadratic equation techniques.
3. **Analyze the remaining condition when the exponent is not zero**: If the exponent $x^2-5x+2$ is not zero, the base $x^2-4x+2$ must equal 1, as any non-zero number raised to a non-zero power equals 1 if and only if the base equals 1.
4. **Solve for the base to be equal to 1**: Set the base $x^2-4x+2$ equal to 1 and solve for $x$ using standard algebraic techniques.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Identify base and exponent conditions**: Recognize that for the equation to hold true, either the base $(x^2-4x+2)$ is $1$, or the exponent $(x^2-5x+2)$ is $0$, or the base is $-1$ and the exponent is an even integer.
2. **Analyze base equal to 1**: Solve the equation $x^2-4x+2 = 1$ to find its real roots.
3. **Analyze base equal to -1**: Solve the equation $x^2-4x+2 = -1$ to find its real roots, and then consider the parity of the exponent $(x^2-5x+2)$.
4. **Analyze exponent equal to 0**: Solve the equation $x^2-5x+2 = 0$ to find its real roots.
5. **Sum the real roots**: Add up the real roots obtained from the previous steps.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Examine the structure of the equation**: Notice that the expression $(x^2-4x+2)^{x^2-5x+2}$ is a power of a quadratic polynomial. To simplify the problem, consider the cases where the exponent is $0$ or the base is $1$.
2. **Case 1: Exponent is 0**: Set $x^2-5x+2=0$ and solve for $x$. This will give us some solutions to the original equation.
3. **Case 2: Base is 1**: Set $x^2-4x+2=1$ and solve for $x$. This will give us another set of solutions to the original equation.
4. **Consider the remaining cases**: If the base is not $1$ and the exponent is not $0$, then the base must be $-1$ (since $(-1)^n = 1$ if and only if $n$ is even). This leads to a new equation to solve for $x$.
5. **Solve the resulting equations**: Use algebraic techniques to solve the equations obtained in the previous steps, and find the real solutions for $x$.

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Start by identifying the constraints imposed by the red hexagon with the R, and determine the color options for the adjacent hexagons.
2. Recognize that the coloring of the hexagons can be broken down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems, such as determining the color options for the top row of hexagons.

1. Identify the coloring constraints for each hexagon: since no two hexagons with a common side can have the same color, the coloring of each hexagon is determined by the color of its adjacent hexagons.

4. Count the number of possible colorings for the core hexagons: using the constraints and reduced problem, count the number of possible colorings for the core hexagons.
5. Use the pattern or recurrence relation to extend the counting to the entire figure: once the number of possible colorings for the core hexagons is determined, use the established pattern or recurrence relation to count the number of possible colorings for the entire figure.

4. Calculate the total number of distinct colorings by combining the number of choices from each step.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. **Examine the structure of the equation**: Notice that the bases of the exponents are consecutive integers, which may suggest a relationship between the terms.
2. **Identify key constraints**: The equation involves powers of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and the sum is equal to 1170, a relatively small number. This may indicate that the value of x is not very large.
3. **Consider a strategy for narrowing down possible values of x**: Given the constraints, look for a way to eliminate or reduce the number of possible values of x, such as using modular arithmetic or looking for patterns in the powers of the bases.
4. **Look for a way to relate the equation to known mathematical concepts or formulas**: The equation involves powers of consecutive integers, which may be related to the concept of arithmetic or geometric progressions.
5. **Explore the use of inequalities or bounds**: Use inequalities such as Bernoulli's inequality or the binomial theorem to establish upper or lower bounds on the value of x.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the given equation is a sum of powers with distinct bases, and consider transforming it into a more manageable form.
2. Observe the large value of the target sum (1170) and hypothesize that x might be a relatively small integer.
3. Consider using modular arithmetic or other number-theoretic techniques to reduce the problem to a more computationally tractable form.
4. Look for patterns or relationships between the terms in the sum that can be exploited to simplify the equation.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Identify key properties of the equation**: Recognize that the equation involves powers of integers, and consider how the growth rates of these powers might be used to constrain possible values of x.
2. **Analyze the growth rates of the terms**: Note that the terms 1^(x+2), 3^(x-1) and 4^x grow much faster than 2^(x+1) as x increases, suggesting that the solution may involve a relatively small value of x.
3. **Consider bounds on x**: Use the fact that the sum of the terms equals 1170 to establish upper and lower bounds on the value of x, and use these bounds to narrow the search for the solution.
4. **Develop a strategy for testing potential values of x**: Based on the bounds established in step 3, decide on a systematic approach for testing potential values of x, such as starting with the lower bound and incrementing upwards.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the given equation**: Notice that the equation involves powers of consecutive integers, starting from 1 and ending at 4, with increasing exponents. This suggests that we might be able to find a pattern or a relationship between the terms.
2. **Identify the dominant term**: Recognize that as x increases, the term with the highest base (4^x) will dominate the sum. This is because the bases 1, 2, and 3 will have smaller exponents, making their contributions relatively smaller.
3. **Establish a range for x**: Use the fact that 4^x grows very rapidly, and 1170 is a relatively small number. This implies that x must be a small positive integer, likely between 1 and 5.
4. **Test values of x within the established range**: Plug in possible values of x, starting from 1, and calculate the sum of the terms. Stop when we find the value of x that satisfies the equation.

3. **Use modular arithmetic or divisibility rules**: Since the equation involves powers of integers, consider using modular arithmetic or divisibility rules to constrain the possible values of $x$.
4. **Apply number theory or combinatorial techniques**: Depending on the nature of the resulting simplified equation, apply number theory or combinatorial techniques to narrow down the possible values of $x$.

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. **Initial Observations**: Note the large value of 1170 and the presence of powers of numbers from 1 to 4. This suggests that the solution may involve a combination of arithmetic and geometric progressions.
2. **Consider the Exponents**: Focus on the exponents of the powers, which are $(x+2)$, $(x+1)$, $(x-1)$, and $x$. The goal is to find a value of $x$ that makes the sum equal to 1170.
3. **Examine the Range of x**: Given that $x$ is a positive integer, start with small values of $x$ (e.g., $x = 1, 2, 3, ...$) and calculate the sum for each value. This will help identify any patterns or restrictions on the possible values of $x$.
4. **Look for Patterns or Simplifications**: Investigate whether the given equation can be simplified or rewritten in a more manageable form, potentially using algebraic manipulations or mathematical identities.

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Initial Analysis**: Recognize that the equation involves powers of integers, and observe that the right-hand side (1170) is a relatively small number, which may help to limit the possible values of $x$.
2. **Simplify and Bound**: Attempt to simplify the equation and find bounds on the value of $x$ by considering the growth rates of the individual terms and the fact that $x$ is a positive integer.
3. **Trial and Error**: Test potential values of $x$ that are within the bounds obtained in Step 2, starting from the lower end of the range, and verify whether any of these values satisfy the equation.
4. **Refine the Solution**: If multiple values of $x$ satisfy the equation, refine the solution by analyzing the behavior of the individual terms and determining which value of $x$ is most likely to be correct.

---

## Proposal 8

3. **Find the range of M**: Multiply both sides by $56$ to obtain $M-14 < 10$, which leads to $M < 24$.
4. **Further constrain M**: Since $\frac{M}{56}$ must be strictly greater than $\frac{14}{56}$, we have $M > 14$.
5. **Determine the integer values of M**: The integers satisfying $14 < M < 24$ are $15, 16, \dots, 23$.
6. **Calculate the average of the integers**: The average of the integers $15, 16, \dots, 23$ is their sum divided by the number of terms, which is $\frac{15 + 23}{2} = 19$.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the total number of employees**: Calculate the sum of the number of employees in each position title to find the total number of employees, which is 59.
2. **Identify the middle value**: Since there are 59 employees (an odd number), the median value will be the salary of the 30th employee.
3. **Sort the employees by salary**: Sort the employees in ascending order of their salaries to find the 30th employee.
4. **Determine the position title of the 30th employee**: Identify the position title of the 30th employee, which will correspond to the median salary.
5. **Find the median salary**: Use the position title of the 30th employee to find the corresponding salary, which will be the median value of the 59 salaries.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Determine the total number of employees (59) and identify the middle value, which is the 30th employee since 59 is an odd number.
2. Analyze the distribution of employees by position title to find the first position that contains at least 30 employees.
3. Identify the median salary as the salary associated with the position title found in step 2.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. First, arrange the 59 salaries in ascending order.
2. Since there are 59 salaries (an odd number), the median will be the salary at the middle position, which is the 30th salary.
3. Identify the positions with salaries less than the median. Since 37 Administrative Specialists have salaries of $\$23{,}000$, which is less than the median, we can immediately conclude that the median salary is at least $\$23{,}000$.
4. Next, consider the remaining employees with higher salaries. There is 1 President, 5 Vice-Presidents, 10 Directors, and 6 Associate Directors, totaling 22 employees with higher salaries. This means that the median salary must be among the top 22 salaries.
5. Since the median salary must be among the top 22 salaries and is at least $\$23{,}000$, the median salary can be $\$23{,}000$ or higher. However, since there are only 22 employees with higher salaries, the median salary cannot be higher than $\$23{,}000$.
6. Therefore, the median salary is $\$23{,}000$.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. First, calculate the total number of employees, which is the sum of the number of employees with each title: 1 + 5 + 10 + 6 + 37 = 59.
2. Since the total number of employees is odd (59), the median value is the middle number, which is the 30th value in the sorted list of salaries.
3. Sort the salaries in ascending order and identify the salary range that includes the 30th value.
4. Determine which position title(s) correspond to the salary range containing the 30th value.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. First, arrange the salaries in ascending order: $\$23{,}000$ (37 times), $\$50{,}000$ (6 times), $\$75{,}000$ (10 times), $\$90{,}000$ (5 times), $\$130{,}000$ (1 time).
2. Since there are 59 salaries, the median is the salary at the 30th position. Given the distribution of salaries, the first 37 positions will have salaries of $\$23{,}000$, and the next 6 positions will have salaries of $\$50{,}000$.
3. The median salary is the 30th position, which falls within the 37 positions with salaries of $\$23{,}000$. Therefore, the median salary is $\$23{,}000$.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. First, we need to understand that the median value of the salaries is the middle value when the salaries are arranged in ascending order.
2. Since there are 59 salaries, the median value will be the 30th salary (since 59 is an odd number, the middle value is the 30th value).
3. We should identify the group(s) of employees that contain the median value by finding the cumulative count of employees with lower salaries than the median value.
4. Next, we need to determine which position title(s) the median value falls under based on the cumulative count of employees with lower salaries.
5. Finally, we can find the median salary by identifying the salary associated with the position title(s) determined in the previous step.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. First, calculate the total number of employees, which is 59.
2. Next, determine the middle value of the salaries by finding the 30th employee, since 59 is an odd number.
3. Consider the distribution of employees by position title and identify the point at which the cumulative count of employees exceeds 30.
4. Determine the median salary by considering the position title(s) corresponding to the 30th employee.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. First, arrange the salaries in ascending order, taking into account the number of employees with each title.
2. Since there are 59 employees, the median will be the 30th salary (since 59 is an odd number).
3. Identify the salary ranges where the 30th position would fall, considering the number of employees with each title.
4. Use the salary of the position title that the 30th position falls within to determine the median value.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1.  **Minimize the sum of the two groups**: To minimize the expression $(a+b+c+d)^{2} + (e+f+g+h)^{2}$, we should aim to make the sums of the two groups $(a+b+c+d)$ and $(e+f+g+h)$ as close to each other as possible.
2.  **Use the constraint that the elements are distinct**: Since the elements in the set are distinct, we can use this constraint to our advantage. By making the sums of the two groups as close to each other as possible, we can minimize the expression.
3.  **Consider the possible values for the sums of the two groups**: The sum of all the elements in the set is $8$. We can use this information to determine the possible values for the sums of the two groups.
4.  **Find the minimum possible value of the expression**: By considering the possible values for the sums of the two groups, we can find the minimum possible value of the expression $(a+b+c+d)^{2} + (e+f+g+h)^{2}$.

The next steps would involve finding the possible values for the sums of the two groups and determining which one leads to the minimum value of the expression.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the expression $(a+b+c+d)^{2} + (e+f+g+h)^{2}$ can be simplified using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or the QM-AM inequality, as it involves the sum of squares.
2. Notice that the sum of all elements in the set is 8, and thus the sum of the elements in each of the two groups must be as close to 4 as possible to minimize the expression.
3. Identify that since the elements are distinct, we should aim to distribute them in such a way that the two groups have sums as close to 4 as possible, while also ensuring that the elements in each group are distinct.
4. Consider using the properties of the set and the constraints of the problem to determine the optimal way to split the elements into two groups.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Group elements into two sets**: Divide the given set into two groups of 4 elements each, denoted as $\{a,b,c,d\}$ and $\{e,f,g,h\}$.
2. **Minimize the sum of squares of means**: Use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to relate the sum of squares of the group sums to the sum of squares of the individual elements.
3. **Apply the rearrangement inequality**: Use the rearrangement inequality to minimize the sum of squares of the group sums.
4. **Compute the minimum value**: Calculate the minimum value of the expression using the result from step 3.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Label the elements**: Label the elements in the set as $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_8$ in increasing order, where $x_1 = -7$ and $x_8 = 13$.
2. **Express the sums in terms of $x_i$**: Express $a+b+c+d$ and $e+f+g+h$ in terms of the $x_i$'s.
3. **Use the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality to the two sums.
4. **Simplify the inequality**: Simplify the resulting inequality and find the minimum possible value.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. **Initial Observation**: The expression $(a+b+c+d)^{2} + (e+f+g+h)^{2}$ is symmetric in $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h$, meaning the order of variables does not affect the value of the expression. This symmetry allows us to focus on the distribution of values rather than their order.
2. **Distribution of Values**: The given set $\{-7,-5,-3,-2,2,4,6,13\}$ has a range of 20 units (from -7 to 13) and a total sum of 8. To minimize the expression, we want to distribute these values as evenly as possible between $(a+b+c+d)$ and $(e+f+g+h)$.
3. **Target Sums**: To achieve the minimum value, we aim to make the two sums as close to each other as possible. The ideal scenario is to have $(a+b+c+d) = (e+f+g+h) = 4$, which would give a value of $32$ for each sum and a total of $64$ for the expression.
4. **Minimizing Deviation**: Since the ideal target sum of 4 cannot be achieved with the given set, we need to find the closest achievable sums. We can do this by examining the possible combinations of values that would result in the smallest deviation from the target sum of 4.
5. **Further Analysis**: The next step would involve examining the possible combinations of values that would result in the smallest deviation from the target sum of 4. This would involve calculating the sum of each subset of four numbers and determining the closest achievable sums to 4.

5. **Numerical evaluation**: Use the insight from the equality condition to evaluate the minimum value.

---

## Proposal 7

1. **Establish the constraint**: Note that the sum of all elements in the set is $8$. This constraint will be crucial in simplifying the expression.
2. **Express the sum of two groups**: Express the sum of the two groups as $(a+b+c+d) + (e+f+g+h) = 8$, which implies that the sum of each group must be $4$.
3. **Use Cauchy-Schwarz inequality**: Apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to find a lower bound for the expression $(a+b+c+d)^{2} + (e+f+g+h)^{2}$.
4. **Find the minimum value**: Determine the minimum value by identifying the equality condition of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.

---

4. Simplify `3n` to find the remainder when divided by 9.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Let's denote the number of pieces in one bag as N. We know that N ≡ 7 (mod 9).
2. The number of pieces in three bags is 3N. We need to find the smallest possible remainder when 3N is divided by 9.
3. To do this, we can use the fact that 3N ≡ 3(7) (mod 9) ≡ 21 (mod 9) ≡ 3 (mod 9).
4. Therefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when 3N is divided among 9 kids is 3.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. Let's assume the number of pieces in one bag is x. When divided by 9, it leaves a remainder of 7, so x = 9k + 7, where k is a non-negative integer.
2. Now, consider three bags, which will have 3x pieces in total. This can be expressed as 3(9k + 7) = 27k + 21.
3. To find the smallest number of pieces that could be left over when divided by 9, we need to find the remainder when 27k + 21 is divided by 9.
4. Since 27k is divisible by 9, the remainder will be determined by the remainder of 21 divided by 9, which is 3.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. Let's denote the number of pieces in one bag as $n$. We know that $n \equiv 7 \pmod{9}$, meaning $n$ leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $9$.
2. Since three bags contain the same number of pieces as $3n$, we can express this as $3n \equiv 21 \pmod{9}$.
3. We can simplify the expression $21 \pmod{9}$ to find the remainder when $3n$ is divided by $9$.
4. The remainder will give us the smallest possible number of pieces left over when the Dummies in three bags are divided equally among the $9$ kids.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Let's assume the number of pieces in one bag is represented by the variable 'n'. We know that when 'n' is divided by 9, the remainder is 7.
2. Mathematically, this can be expressed as n ≡ 7 (mod 9).
3. When three bags are divided among 9 kids, the total number of pieces is 3n. We need to find the remainder when 3n is divided by 9.
4. Using the property of modular arithmetic, we can express 3n as 3(n ≡ 7 (mod 9)).
5. By applying the multiplication property of modular arithmetic, we can rewrite this as 3n ≡ 21 (mod 9).
6. To find the remainder, we can simplify 21 (mod 9) by dividing 21 by 9, which gives us a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 3.
7. Therefore, the smallest number of pieces that could possibly be left over when three bags are divided among 9 kids is 3.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Let the number of pieces in one bag be $N$. Since $N$ leaves a remainder of $7$ when divided by $9$, we can write $N = 9a + 7$ for some integer $a$.
2. The number of pieces in three bags is $3N = 3(9a + 7) = 27a + 21$.
3. We want to find the smallest possible remainder when $3N$ is divided by $9$.
4. Notice that $27a$ is always divisible by $9$, so it will not contribute to the remainder when $3N$ is divided by $9$.
5. Therefore, the remainder is solely determined by the remainder when $21$ is divided by $9$.
6. The remainder when $21$ is divided by $9$ is $3$.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Let's denote the number of pieces in one bag as `n`. We know that `n ≡ 7 (mod 9)`, meaning `n` leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 9.
2. Consider the scenario where three bags are divided equally among 9 kids. The total number of pieces is `3n`.
3. We need to find the smallest possible remainder when `3n` is divided by 9, given that `n ≡ 7 (mod 9)`.
4. To find this remainder, we can use the properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the expression `3n (mod 9)`.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. Let's represent the number of pieces in one bag as "x". Since the pieces can't be divided equally among 9 kids with 7 pieces left over, we can write the equation x ≡ 7 (mod 9).
2. When three bags are considered, the total number of pieces is 3x. We need to find the smallest possible remainder when 3x is divided by 9.
3. To simplify the problem, we can rewrite the equation 3x ≡ ? (mod 9) in terms of the original equation x ≡ 7 (mod 9).
4. Multiplying the original equation by 3, we get 3x ≡ 21 (mod 9). We can simplify this further by taking the modulus of 21 with respect to 9, which is 6.
5. Now we have 3x ≡ 6 (mod 9), which means that when 3x is divided by 9, the remainder is 6.

3. **Simplify the expression using the fact that $a_i^2 = 1$**: Note that $a_i^2 = 1$ for all $i$, so the expression simplifies to $\sum_{1 \le i < j \le 95} a_i a_j = \frac{1}{2} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2 - \frac{95}{2}$.
4. **Minimize the square of the sum of $a_i$**: Use the fact that $\left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2$ is a perfect square to minimize its value.
5. **Consider the parity of the sum of $a_i$**: Note that the sum of $a_i$ is odd, as there are 47 more $+1$'s than $-1$'s. This means that $\left( \sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i \right)^2$ is an odd perfect square.
6. **Find the smallest odd perfect square greater than 95**: The smallest odd perfect square greater than 95 is $11^2 = 121$.
7. **Compute the minimum value of the given sum**: Plug in $121$ to the expression from step 3 to get $\frac{1}{2} (121) - \frac{95}{2} = 13$.

This approach provides a clear and concise solution to the problem.

---

## Proposal 8

2. **Express the sum in terms of the square of the sum**: Focus on minimizing the square of the sum $\left(\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i\right)^2$.
3. **Apply the pigeonhole principle or parity argument**: Analyze the parity of the sum $\sum_{i=1}^{95} a_i$ and its relation to the sum $\sum_{1 \le i < j \le 95} a_i a_j$ to derive a lower bound.
4. **Determine the optimal configuration**: Based on the lower bound, determine the optimal configuration of $a_i$'s to achieve the smallest possible positive value of the sum.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Determine the total number of candies Daniel needs to distribute to his 3 sisters by dividing 20 by 3, which will give a quotient and a remainder.
2. Identify the remainder as the number of candies that need to be removed to achieve equal distribution among the 3 sisters.
3. Since the remainder represents the excess candies that cannot be evenly divided, subtracting this remainder will give the least number of pieces Daniel should take away.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. First, we need to find the largest number of pieces Daniel can give to each sister without taking any away, which is the largest multiple of 3 that is less than or equal to 20.
2. Next, we need to find the difference between 20 and this largest multiple, which will be the minimum number of pieces Daniel needs to take away.
3. This difference will give us the least number of pieces Daniel should take away so that he could distribute the candy equally.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the total number of candies that can be evenly distributed among the sisters**: This involves finding the largest number that divides 20 exactly, which is 20 itself. However, since the candies must be divided equally among 3 sisters, we need to find the largest number that divides 20 and is also divisible by 3.
2. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 20 and 3**: The GCD of 20 and 3 is 1, which means that 20 is not divisible by 3. However, this is not the correct approach, as we are looking for the number of pieces Daniel should take away, not the GCD.
3. **Determine the remainder when 20 is divided by 3**: 20 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 2. This is the key insight to solving the problem.
4. **Find the number of pieces Daniel should take away**: Since the remainder is 2, Daniel should take away 2 pieces of candy so that he can distribute the remaining candies equally among his sisters.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the total number of candies each sister should receive**: Since Daniel wants to distribute the candies equally, we need to find the maximum number of candies that can be divided by 3 without leaving a remainder.
2. **Find the remainder when 20 is divided by 3**: Calculate the remainder when 20 is divided by 3 to determine how many candies are left over.
3. **Calculate the minimum number of candies to take away**: Subtract the remainder from 20 to find the minimum number of candies Daniel needs to take away to distribute the remaining candies equally among his sisters.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Determine the total number of pieces each sister would receive if the candy were divided equally among them, which is $20 \div 3 = 6\frac{2}{3}$.
2. Find the greatest multiple of 3 less than 20, which is 18, as this would be the number of pieces each sister could receive with no remainder.
3. Calculate the number of pieces that need to be taken away, which is $20 - 18 = 2$.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Determine the total number of pieces Daniel has to distribute and the number of sisters to distribute them to, which are given as 20 and 3, respectively.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Determine the total number of candies Daniel has and the number of sisters he needs to divide them among.
2. Recognize that for the candies to be distributed equally, the total number of candies must be divisible by the number of sisters.
3. Find the remainder when 20 is divided by 3.
4. The least number of pieces Daniel should take away is equal to the remainder found in step 3.

---

## Proposal 8

2. Since the median is five less than the mean, the mean is 19.

---

## Proposal 5

5. Use the constraints to narrow down the possible values of $a$, $b$, and $c$ and identify the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ that satisfies the conditions.

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Express A_n, B_n, C_n in terms of a, b, c, and n**: Write A_n = a \* (10^(n-1) + 10^(n-2) + ... + 1), B_n = b \* (10^(n-1) + 10^(n-2) + ... + 1), and C_n = c \* (10^(2n-1) + 10^(2n-2) + ... + 1).

3. **Analyze the equation for possible values of a, b, c**: Use the simplified equation from step 2 to analyze the possible values of a, b, and c that satisfy the equation for at least two values of n.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1.  Identify the constraints and the objective: The problem asks for the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$ for which there are at least two values of $n$ such that $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$. The constraints are that $a$, $b$, and $c$ are nonzero digits and $n$ is a positive integer.
2.  Express the given condition in a more manageable form: The equation $C_n - B_n = A_n^2$ can be rewritten as $(10^{2n} + c(10^n + 10^{2n-1} + \cdots + 1)) - (10^n + b(10^{n-1} + \cdots + 1)) = (10^n + a(10^{n-1} + \cdots + 1))^2$.
3.  Simplify the equation and identify the key relationships: This can be simplified to $(c-1)10^{2n} + (c-b)10^n - (a^2-2a)10^n - a^2 = 0$.
4.  Analyze the equation and the constraints to determine the approach to finding the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$: Since there are at least two values of $n$, the equation must hold true for two distinct values of $n$. This implies that the coefficients of the powers of $10^n$ must be equal to zero.
5.  Consider the cases where the coefficients of the powers of $10^n$ are equal to zero: There are two cases to consider: when $c-1 = 0$ and when $c-b = 0$. If $c-1 = 0$, then $c = 1$, which contradicts the fact that $c$ is a nonzero digit. Therefore, we must consider the case when $c-b = 0$, which implies that $c = b$.
6.  Consider the implications of $c = b$ and determine the approach to finding the greatest possible value of $a + b + c$: Since $c = b$, the equation simplifies to $(c-1)10^{2n} - (a^2-2a)10^n - a^2 = 0$. This implies that the coefficient of the power of $10^n$ must be equal to zero, which gives the equation $a^2 -

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. To find the largest value of $c$ such that $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$, we need to determine the conditions under which the equation $x^2-5x+c=1$ has real roots, as this would indicate that $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$.
2. We can rewrite the equation as $x^2-5x+(c-1)=0$ and use the discriminant to determine the conditions for real roots.
3. The discriminant of the quadratic equation $ax^2+bx+c=0$ is given by $\Delta=b^2-4ac$. We can use this to derive the condition for real roots in the equation $x^2-5x+(c-1)=0$.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that for $1$ to be in the range of $f(x)$, there must exist a real root of the equation $f(x) = 1$, which leads to the quadratic equation $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$.
2. Recall that a quadratic equation has a real root if and only if its discriminant is nonnegative.
3. Express the condition for the discriminant of $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$ to be nonnegative, which involves a quadratic inequality in $c$.
4. Solve the quadratic inequality to find the largest possible value of $c$.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the vertex of the parabola**: Since the vertex of the parabola $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ is the minimum point, it will be the lowest value of the function, and we want $1$ to be in the range, so the vertex should be at $y = 1$ or below.
2. **Express the vertex in terms of c**: The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by $x = -b / 2a = 5 / 2$. The y-coordinate of the vertex is $f(5/2) = (5/2)^2 - 5(5/2) + c = 25/4 - 25/2 + c = c - 25/4$.
3. **Set up the inequality for c**: For the vertex to be at $y = 1$ or below, we need $c - 25/4 \le 1$.
4. **Solve for c**: Rearranging the inequality, we get $c \le 1 + 25/4 = 29/4$.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the vertex of the parabola**: Since the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, the parabola opens upwards. The vertex of the parabola is the minimum point, and the value of $f(x)$ at the vertex is $f(-\frac{b}{2a})$.
2. **Set up an inequality for the vertex value**: We need $f(-\frac{b}{2a}) \geq 1$ to ensure that $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$.
3. **Solve for c**: Use the inequality to solve for the largest possible value of $c$.
4. **Verify the solution**: Check that the solution satisfies the original condition that $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$.

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the vertex of the parabola**: Express the quadratic function in vertex form to identify the minimum value of the function, which will be the lowest point of the parabola.
2. **Analyze the range of the function**: Use the fact that the range of a quadratic function is all real numbers greater than or equal to the minimum value of the function.
3. **Relate the range to the value of $c$**: Determine the condition on $c$ that ensures the minimum value of the function is greater than or equal to $1$.
4. **Find the largest possible value of $c$**: Use algebraic manipulation to find the largest possible value of $c$ that satisfies the condition.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the function's vertex**: Since $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ is a quadratic function, its vertex represents the minimum or maximum value of the function.
2. **Express the vertex in terms of c**: Find the x-coordinate of the vertex using the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a = 1$ and $b = -5$. Then, substitute this x-coordinate into the original function to express the y-coordinate in terms of c.
3. **Determine the condition for 1 to be in the range**: Since the vertex represents the minimum value of the function, 1 must be greater than or equal to the y-coordinate of the vertex. Set up an inequality based on this condition and solve for c.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Analyze the quadratic function**: Understand that $f(x) = x^2 - 5x + c$ is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola that opens upwards.
2. **Determine the vertex**: Recognize that the vertex of the parabola is the minimum or maximum point of the function, which can help determine the range of the function.
3. **Find the vertex's x-coordinate**: Use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$ to find the x-coordinate of the vertex, where $a = 1$ and $b = -5$.
4. **Relate the vertex to the range**: Understand that if the vertex's y-coordinate is negative, then the parabola does not intersect the x-axis, and $1$ is not in the range of $f(x)$.
5. **Derive a condition on c**: Use the vertex's y-coordinate to derive a condition on $c$ such that the parabola intersects the x-axis, and $1$ is in the range of $f(x)$.
6. **Solve for the largest c**: Solve the condition on $c$ to find the largest value of $c$ that satisfies the given condition.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Express the condition for 1 to be in the range of f(x)**: We need to find the largest value of $c$ such that the equation $f(x) = 1$ has real roots.
2. **Transform the equation into a quadratic equation in x**: Substitute $f(x) = 1$ into the equation to get $x^2 - 5x + c = 1$, which simplifies to $x^2 - 5x + (c - 1) = 0$.
3. **Apply the discriminant condition for real roots**: The quadratic equation has real roots if and only if the discriminant $b^2 - 4ac \geq 0$. In this case, $a = 1$, $b = -5$, and $c$ is $c - 1$ from the quadratic equation.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Calculate the total distance traveled by the ball during its descent and ascent for each bounce, considering the ball rebounds half the distance it falls.
2. Identify the pattern of the sequence of distances traveled for each bounce and find the sum of the first four terms of the sequence.
3. Account for the fact that the ball hits the ground the fourth time after its last ascent, so we need to include the distance traveled during the last descent.
4. Compute the total distance traveled by adding up the distances for all four bounces, including the last descent.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Break down the motion of the ball into its downward and upward segments, and calculate the total distance traveled for each segment separately.
2. For the downward segments, recognize that the ball falls from a fixed height each time, which is half the height of the previous fall. This forms a geometric series with a common ratio of 1/2.
3. For the upward segments, note that the ball rebounds to the same height as the previous downward segment, but in the opposite direction. This means that each upward segment is equal in distance to the corresponding downward segment.
4. Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate the total distance traveled for each segment.
5. Add the total distances of the downward and upward segments together to find the total distance traveled when the ball hits the ground the fourth time.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled during the first two bounces**: The ball falls 100 feet, rebounds 50 feet, falls 50 feet, and rebounds 25 feet, resulting in a total distance of 100 + 50 + 50 + 25 = 225 feet.
2. **Determine the total distance traveled for the fourth hit**: The ball will fall 25 feet on its fourth hit, and we need to add this to the total distance calculated in step 1.
3. **Calculate the total distance traveled when the ball hits the ground for the fourth time**: Add the distance from step 1 to the distance of the fourth hit (25 feet) to get the final answer.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled on the way down**: The ball travels 100 feet on the way down initially.
2. **Calculate the total distance traveled on the way up and down for each rebound**: Since the ball rebounds half the distance it falls, the distances traveled on the way up and down for each subsequent rebound form a geometric sequence.
3. **Sum the distances traveled for the first four hits**: Add the initial 100 feet to the sum of the distances traveled on the way up and down for the three rebounds.
4. **Account for the final hit**: Since the ball travels the same distance on the way up as it did on the way down, the final hit distance should be counted only once.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled downwards**: The ball falls 100 feet on the first drop, 50 feet on the second drop, 25 feet on the third drop, and 12.5 feet on the fourth drop (since it rebounds half the distance each time).
2. **Calculate the total distance traveled upwards**: The ball rebounds 50 feet on the first bounce, 25 feet on the second bounce, 12.5 feet on the third bounce, and 6.25 feet on the fourth bounce (since it rebounds half the distance each time).
3. **Add the distances traveled downwards and upwards**: Combine the distances calculated in steps 1 and 2 to get the total distance traveled by the ball when it hits the ground the fourth time.
4. **Round the final answer**: The ball travels a total distance of 218.75 feet when it hits the ground the fourth time.

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the pattern of the ball's motion**: The ball travels downwards a certain distance, rebounds back up a certain distance, and then repeats the process.

3. **Calculate the total distance traveled on each rebound**: The ball rebounds 100 feet on the first rebound, 50 feet on the second rebound, 25 feet on the third rebound, and an unknown distance on the fourth rebound.
4. **Sum the distances of the descents and rebounds**: Add up the distances traveled on each descent and each rebound to find the total distance traveled when the ball hits the ground for the fourth time.
5. **Apply the formula for the sum of a geometric series**: Recognize that the distances traveled on each descent and each rebound form a geometric series, and apply the formula to find the total distance traveled.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the pattern of distances**: Recognize that the ball travels a certain distance downward and then rebounds back up to a fraction of that distance, creating a geometric sequence.
2. **Determine the total distance traveled for each bounce**: Calculate the total distance traveled for each bounce, taking into account both the downward and upward movements.
3. **Sum the distances for the first four bounces**: Use the formula for the sum of a geometric series to calculate the total distance traveled when the ball hits the ground the fourth time.
4. **Consider the initial drop**: Add the initial 100 feet to the total distance calculated in step 3.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Break down the problem into segments**: Calculate the total distance traveled by the ball as it falls and rebounds separately.
2. **Calculate the total distance of each segment**: Determine the distance traveled by the ball for each fall and rebound, noting that the rebound distance is half of the previous fall.

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Consider the birch trees as dividers and the non-birch trees as "open" slots between them. We will count the number of ways to arrange the birch trees in these slots.
2. Since there are 7 non-birch trees (3 maple and 4 oak) and 5 birch trees, there are 8 slots to place the birch trees.
3. The birch trees can be placed in these slots in ${8\choose5} = 56$ ways.
4. However, we need to consider the arrangements of the non-birch trees, which can be done in ${12 \choose 4}$ ways.

3.  Since there are 5 birch trees, we can think of placing the birch trees in the slots first, and then filling the remaining slots with the other trees.
4.  To ensure that the birch trees are not adjacent, we can place the birch trees in the slots separated by the other trees. This can be done in ${8\choose5}$ ways.
5.  Next, we need to count the total number of ways to arrange the 12 trees in the 12 slots, which is $12!$.
6.  The probability that no two birch trees are next to one another is then $\frac{{8\choose5}}{12!}$.

5. **Simplify the fraction**: Express the probability as a simplified fraction and find the sum of the numerator and denominator.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Consider the birch trees as a single unit**: Since we're only concerned with the probability of no two birch trees being adjacent, we can treat the five birch trees as a single unit, which we'll call a "super-birch".
2. **Count the number of arrangements of the super-birch and other trees**: We now have eight units to arrange: the super-birch and the seven non-birch trees (three maple and four oak). We'll use combinatorics to count the number of ways to arrange these units.
3. **Apply a combinatorial argument to account for birch tree arrangements within the super-birch**: Once we have the number of arrangements of the super-birch and other trees, we'll need to consider the number of ways the birch trees can be arranged within the super-birch unit.

3. Apply the difference of squares formula to find the value of $31^2 - 30^2$.
4. Realize that the same logic can be applied to find the value of $29^2 - 30^2$.

6. Calculate the product of the two consecutive numbers to find the value of $29^2 - 30^2$.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that Emily is using a difference of squares identity: $(a+b)^2 - a^2 = 2ab + b^2$ and $(a-b)^2 - a^2 = 2ab - b^2$.
2. Identify the base case and the increment/decrement: $a = 30$, and $b = 1$ for $31^2$ and $b = 1$ for $29^2$.
3. Apply the appropriate identity: for $31^2$, use $(a+b)^2 - a^2 = 2ab + b^2$ and for $29^2$, use $(a-b)^2 - a^2 = 2ab - b^2$.
4. Calculate the result: for $31^2$, $2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 61$; for $29^2$, $2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 - 1^2 = 59$.

---

## Proposal 3

3. For the $29^2$ calculation, identify that she's using the formula with $a = 30$ and $b = -1$.
4. Calculate $2ab$ for $b = -1$ to find the number Emily subtracts.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that Emily's approach is based on the difference of squares formula, which can be expressed as $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ and $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$.

3. Use the formula $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$ to find the number Emily subtracts, where $a=30$ and $b=1$.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that Emily's approach is based on the formula $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$ and $(a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$.
2. For $31^2$, Emily uses the first formula with $a=30$ and $b=1$, which is why she adds $2ab = 2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 = 60$ to $30^2$.
3. For $29^2$, Emily will use the second formula with $a=30$ and $b=1$, which means she will subtract $2ab = 2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 = 60$ from $30^2$.
4. However, this is not the only term being subtracted. The formula $(a-b)^2$ also includes a $b^2$ term, which in this case is $1^2 = 1$. So, the total number Emily subtracts is $60 + 1 = 61$.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that Emily is using the difference of squares formula, which is $(a + b)^2 - (a - b)^2 = 4ab$, to calculate the squares.
2. Identify that for $31^2$, she is calculating $(30 + 1)^2$, which is equivalent to $30^2 + 2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 + 1^2$.
3. Notice that Emily is using the fact that $(30 + 1)^2 - (30 - 1)^2 = 4 \cdot 30 \cdot 1$, which is equal to $120$.
4. Since she is adding $61$ to $30^2$, we can set up the equation $(30 + 1)^2 = 30^2 + 61$.
5. Solve for the number she subtracts to calculate $29^2$ by using the same logic and setting up the equation $(30 - 1)^2 = 30^2 - x$, where $x$ is the number she subtracts.

By following these steps, we can find the number that Emily subtracts to calculate $29^2$.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that Emily's method is based on the algebraic identity $(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2$.
2. For $31^2$, Emily calculates $30^2$ and adds $2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 61$.
3. For $29^2$, apply the same identity, recognizing that Emily is effectively calculating $(30-1)^2 = 30^2 - 2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 + 1^2$.
4. Therefore, the number she subtracts is $2 \cdot 30 \cdot 1 - 1^2 = 59$.

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

2. Use the given information (12 customers buying a $\$500$toaster) to determine the constant of proportionality.
3. Apply the constant of proportionality to the new scenario (toaster costing $\$750$) to find the number of customers that would buy it.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. Let's denote the number of customers who buy a toaster as C and the cost of the toaster as P. According to Daniel's theory, C is inversely proportional to P, which can be expressed as C = k/P, where k is a constant.
2. We can use the given information to find the value of the constant k. When P = $500, C = 12, so we have 12 = k/500.
3. We can then solve for k to get k = 12 * 500 = 6000.
4. Now that we have the value of k, we can use it to find the number of customers who would buy a toaster that costs $750. We can plug in P = 750 into the equation C = k/P to get C = 6000/750.
5. We can then simplify this expression to find the number of customers who would buy the toaster that costs $750.

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. Let's define the relationship between the popularity of the toaster and its cost using the inverse proportionality equation: $p = \frac{k}{c}$, where $p$ is the popularity (number of customers), $c$ is the cost, and $k$ is the constant of proportionality.
2. We can use the given information to find the value of the constant $k$ by substituting $p = 12$ and $c = 500$ into the equation.
3. Once we find the value of $k$, we can use it to calculate the popularity of the toaster that costs $\$750$ by substituting $c = 750$ into the equation.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Let's denote the number of customers who buy a toaster as $c$ and the cost of the toaster as $x$. According to Daniel's theory, $c$ is inversely proportional to $x$, which means $c = \frac{k}{x}$, where $k$ is a constant.
2. We can use the given information to find the value of $k$. Since 12 customers buy a toaster that costs $500, we can set up the equation $12 = \frac{k}{500}$ and solve for $k$.
3. Once we have the value of $k$, we can use it to find the number of customers who would buy a toaster that costs $750$ by plugging $x = 750$ into the equation $c = \frac{k}{x}$.

3. Solve for `k` to get `k = 12 * 500 = 6000`.
4. Now that we have the value of `k`, we can use it to find the number of customers who would buy a toaster that costs $\$750$. We can substitute `x = 750` into the equation `y = k/x` to get `y = 6000/750`.

3. Use the given information to find the value of $k$: $500 = \frac{k}{12}$.
4. Solve for $k$ and then use it to find the number of customers who would buy a toaster that costs $\$750$.

This approach breaks down the problem into manageable steps and sets the stage for a clean and insightful solution.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. **Model the problem as a string**: Represent each house as a character in a string, where "M" denotes a house receiving mail and "N" denotes a house not receiving mail.
2. **Identify constraints**: No two adjacent houses can receive mail on the same day, so "MM" is not allowed. Also, no more than two houses in a row can not receive mail, so "NNN" is not allowed.
3. **Explore possible patterns**: Consider sequences of "M"s and "N"s that satisfy the constraints, and count the number of possible patterns.
4. **Use recursion or dynamic programming**: Develop a recursive or dynamic programming approach to systematically generate and count all possible patterns.
5. **Account for boundary conditions**: Ensure that the approach handles the first and last houses correctly, as they may have different constraints than interior houses.
6. **Count and refine**: Count the total number of patterns and refine the approach as needed to ensure accuracy and efficiency.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Model the problem as a sequence**: Represent each house as a position in a sequence, where a 1 indicates a house receiving mail and a 0 indicates a house not receiving mail.
2. **Identify constraints and formulate a recursive relationship**: Based on the problem statement, define a recursive relationship that captures the constraints of no two adjacent houses receiving mail on the same day and at most two consecutive houses not receiving mail.
3. **Analyze the base cases**: Determine the number of valid patterns for small sequences (e.g., 1, 2, 3 houses) to establish a foundation for the recursive relationship.
4. **Solve the recursion**: Use the recursive relationship and base cases to derive a closed-form expression for the number of valid patterns for a sequence of 19 houses.
5. **Consider any necessary adjustments**: Account for any potential overcounting or edge cases that may arise from the recursive relationship.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Model the problem as a sequence of blocks**: Represent each house that receives mail as a "1" and each house that doesn't receive mail as a "0".
2. **Identify the constraints**: Note that no two adjacent houses can have the same value (1 or 0), and no more than two consecutive 0's are allowed.
3. **Develop a recursive relationship**: Consider how a valid pattern can be extended by appending a 0 or a 1, and identify the conditions under which this extension is valid.
4. **Count the number of valid patterns**: Use the recursive relationship to calculate the total number of valid patterns, considering the base cases and the transitions between them.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Model the problem as a string of letters**: Represent "mail" as "M" and "no mail" as "N". The problem then becomes counting the number of strings of length 19 consisting of M's and N's.
2. **Identify constraints on adjacent letters**: No two adjacent houses can get mail on the same day, so MN cannot appear. However, NNN cannot appear, but MMM can.
3. **Find a pattern or recurrence**: Consider how patterns can be formed by appending M's and N's to existing patterns.
4. **Develop a recursive or dynamic programming approach**: Use the identified constraints and pattern to calculate the number of possible patterns of mail delivery.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. **Model the problem as a sequence of binary choices**: Represent each house as a binary variable (0 or 1), where 0 indicates no mail and 1 indicates mail delivery. This allows us to focus on the sequence of mail delivery patterns rather than the individual houses.
2. **Identify the constraints as regular expressions**: The constraints "no two adjacent houses ever get mail on the same day" and "never more than two houses in a row that get no mail on the same day" can be represented as regular expressions to limit the possible sequences.
3. **Count the number of valid sequences**: Using the regular expressions, count the number of distinct sequences that satisfy both constraints.
4. **Consider the boundary cases**: Account for the fact that the first and last houses may have different constraints due to the edges of the sequence.
5. **Summarize the results**: Combine the counts from each case to obtain the total number of different patterns of mail delivery possible.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. **Represent the problem as a string**: Model each day as a character in a string, with a '1' representing a house receiving mail and a '0' representing a house not receiving mail.
2. **Apply constraints to the string**: Consider the given constraints: no two adjacent houses receive mail on the same day, and there are never more than two houses in a row that don't receive mail on the same day. This will help us determine the possible patterns of mail delivery.
3. **Develop a recursive relationship**: Identify a recursive relationship between the possible patterns for a given string length and the possible patterns for shorter string lengths. This will allow us to build up to the solution for the 19-house problem.
4. **Count the distinct patterns**: Use the recursive relationship to count the distinct patterns of mail delivery that satisfy the given constraints.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Represent the mail delivery pattern as a string of H's and E's**: H represents a house that receives mail, and E represents a house that does not receive mail.
2. **Consider the constraints on the string**: Since no two adjacent houses receive mail on the same day, there can be no consecutive H's. Additionally, there can be at most two consecutive E's.
3. **Use a state machine or recursion to count the number of valid patterns**: Define a set of states that represent the last two characters of the string (e.g., HE, EH, HH, EE) and transition between these states based on the constraints.
4. **Calculate the number of valid patterns starting from each state**: Use the transition rules to recursively calculate the number of valid patterns starting from each state.
5. **Sum up the number of valid patterns from all states**: Add up the number of valid patterns from each state to get the total number of different patterns of mail delivery.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Define a sequence notation**: Represent each house as a sequence of letters, where "M" denotes a house receiving mail, and "N" denotes a house not receiving mail.
2. **Establish a recurrence relation**: Derive a recurrence relation to count the number of patterns, taking into account the constraints on adjacent and consecutive houses.
3. **Solve the recurrence relation**: Find a closed-form expression for the number of patterns, using techniques such as generating functions or linear algebra.
4. **Apply boundary conditions**: Use the given constraints to determine the base cases for the recurrence relation and solve for the number of patterns.

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Understand the relationship between lcm, gcd, and factors**: Recognize that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[\nu,20]=60$ implies $\nu \times 20 = \text{gcd}(\nu,20) \times 60$ due to the fundamental property that $\mathop{\text{lcm}}[a,b] \times \text{gcd}(a,b) = a \times b$.
2. **Analyze the prime factorization of 20 and 60**: Identify the prime factorization of 20 as $2^2 \times 5$ and of 60 as $2^2 \times 3 \times 5$.
3. **Determine the possible values of ν**: Use the relationship from step 1 and the prime factorizations from step 2 to deduce that $\nu$ must be divisible by 3, but not by 9, and must not introduce any additional prime factors beyond those in 60.
4. **Enumerate potential values of ν**: List all positive integers that meet the criteria identified in step 3, focusing on multiples of 3 that fit the given conditions.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. **Calculate the total number of outcomes**: There are 6^6 possible outcomes when rolling 6 dice, as each die has 6 possible results.
2. **Count the number of outcomes with all distinct numbers**: Use a "stars and bars" combinatorial approach to count the number of ways to assign 6 distinct numbers to 6 dice.
3. **Subtract the number of outcomes with all distinct numbers from the total number of outcomes**: This will give us the number of outcomes where at least two dice show the same number.
4. **Calculate the probability**: Divide the number of outcomes where at least two dice show the same number by the total number of outcomes.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes**: Since each die has 6 possible outcomes, there are $6^6$ possible outcomes in total.
2. **Find the number of outcomes where all dice show different numbers**: We can think of this as arranging 6 distinct numbers in 6 positions, which can be done in $6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6!$ ways.
3. **Use complementary probability to find the probability of at least two dice showing the same number**: The probability of at least two dice showing the same number is 1 minus the probability that all dice show different numbers.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes**: Determine the total number of ways the 6 dice can land, which is 6^6 since each die has 6 possible outcomes and there are 6 dice.
2. **Find the number of ways all dice show different numbers**: Use a combinatorial approach to find the number of ways to select 6 distinct numbers from 6 possible numbers, and then calculate the number of ways to arrange these numbers on the dice.

4. **Simplify and calculate the final probability**: Simplify the expression and calculate the final probability.

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

2. **Count the number of ways to avoid identical numbers**: This can be done by using the concept of permutations, where each die is distinct. The number of ways to choose 6 distinct numbers from 6 possible numbers is 6! (6 factorial).
3. **Calculate the probability of no identical numbers**: Divide the number of ways to avoid identical numbers (6!) by the total number of outcomes (6^6).
4. **Calculate the probability of at least two identical numbers**: Subtract the probability of no identical numbers from 1 to get the desired probability.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. **Count the complement**: Instead of directly counting the number of ways to get at least two dice showing the same number, count the number of ways to get no dice showing the same number (i.e., all dice show different numbers) and subtract this from the total number of outcomes.

2. **Use permutations to count distinct outcomes**: For 6 dice, there are 6! = 720 ways to arrange the numbers 1 through 6, since each die can take on any of the 6 numbers.

3. **Account for the fact that order doesn't matter**: Since we're counting distinct outcomes (i.e., all dice showing different numbers), we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange the 6 distinct numbers, which is 6! itself.

4. **Calculate the probability of the complement**: Divide the number of ways to get all dice showing different numbers by the total number of outcomes (6^6) to get the probability of the complement.

5. **Subtract the complement from 1**: To find the probability of at least two dice showing the same number, subtract the probability of the complement from 1.

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Count the complement**: Instead of directly counting the number of ways to get at least two dice showing the same number, count the number of ways to get no dice showing the same number (i.e., all dice show different numbers) and subtract from the total number of possible outcomes.
2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes**: Since each die has 6 possible outcomes and there are 6 dice, the total number of possible outcomes is 6^6.
3. **Count the number of ways to get all dice showing different numbers**: This is equivalent to counting the number of permutations of 6 distinct numbers (1 through 6) taken 6 at a time, which is 6!.
4. **Calculate the probability of getting all dice showing different numbers**: Divide the number of ways to get all dice showing different numbers by the total number of possible outcomes.
5. **Subtract from 1 to get the probability of at least two dice showing the same number**: This is because the event of interest (at least two dice showing the same number) is the complement of the event of getting all dice showing different numbers.

---

## Proposal 8

3. **Calculate the Total Outcomes**: Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling 6 dice (6^6).
4. **Compute the Probability**: Compute the probability that no two dice show the same number by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total outcomes.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Identify the two scenarios that satisfy the condition of at least 5 people staying the entire time: (i) all 6 people stay, and (ii) 5 people stay.
2. Calculate the probability of each scenario separately. For scenario (i), we need to find the probability that all 3 uncertain people stay, which is (2/5)^3. For scenario (ii), we need to find the probability that exactly 2 of the uncertain people stay, which involves combinations and conditional probabilities.
3. Use the Law of Total Probability to combine the probabilities of the two scenarios, taking into account the probability of each scenario occurring.
4. Simplify the expression to obtain the final probability.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the scenarios for "at least 5 people stayed the entire time"**: This condition can be met in two scenarios: all 6 people stayed the entire time, or 5 people stayed the entire time and 1 person left early.
2. **Calculate the probability of the first scenario (all 6 people stayed)**: This is straightforward since 3 people are certain to stay and the other 3 are 2/5 sure to stay, so we can calculate the combined probability of all 3 uncertain people staying.
3. **Calculate the probability of the second scenario (5 people stayed)**: We need to consider the cases where one of the uncertain people leaves early, and the other two stay. We'll need to account for the different combinations of which uncertain person leaves early.
4. **Combine the probabilities of the two scenarios**: We'll add the probabilities of the two scenarios to get the overall probability of at least 5 people staying the entire time.

## Proposal 3

2. **Calculate the probability** of each scenario: (i) all 6 people stay, which is easy since 3 are certain to stay, and (ii) exactly 5 people stay, which involves calculating the probability of one of the uncertain people leaving early.
3. **Use complementary counting** to simplify the calculation of the probability of exactly 5 people staying: find the probability of the complementary event (i.e., 4 people staying) and subtract it from 1.
4. **Apply the binomial probability formula** to calculate the probabilities involved in steps 2 and 3.
5. **Combine the probabilities** from steps 2 and 3 to find the overall probability of at least 5 people staying.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the two mutually exclusive cases**: We need to consider two cases where at least 5 people stay the entire time: 
   - All 6 people stay the entire time.
   - 5 people stay the entire time (and 1 person leaves early).

2. **Calculate the probability for each case**: 
   - Case 1: All 6 people stay. Since 3 people are guaranteed to stay, we only need to find the probability that the 3 uncertain people stay. We'll use the probability of each uncertain person staying (2/5) and multiply them together.

3. **Apply the law of total probability**: We'll use the law of total probability to add the probabilities of the two cases.

4. **Calculate the probability of each uncertain person leaving early**: We'll use the complement of the probability of staying (3/5) to find the probability of leaving early.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. **Polynomial long division**: Divide $(x + 1)^{2010}$ by $x^2 + x + 1$ to find the quotient and remainder.
2. **Use the remainder theorem**: Since the degree of the remainder must be less than the degree of the divisor, the remainder will be a polynomial of degree 1 or less.
3. **Look for a pattern**: Recognize that $(x + 1)^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}$, which suggests a periodicity in the powers of $(x + 1)$ modulo $x^2 + x + 1$.
4. **Reduce the exponent**: Express $2010$ in terms of multiples of 3 and find a simpler expression for $(x + 1)^{2010}$ using the periodicity found in step 3.

---

## Proposal 2

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

2. Apply polynomial long division or recognize a pattern to reduce the problem to finding the remainder of $(x + 1)^{2010}$ when divided by $x^2 + x + 1$, using the fact that $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$.
3. Utilize the Binomial Theorem to expand $(x + 1)^{2010}$ and identify terms that are multiples of the divisor $x^2 + x + 1$.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. **Notice the divisor is a quadratic equation**: Observe that $x^2 + x + 1$ is a quadratic equation with no real roots.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. **Observe the polynomial remainder theorem**: The remainder when a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x - a$ is $f(a)$. However, in this case, we're dividing by a quadratic polynomial, so we need a different approach.
2. **Find a pattern using modular arithmetic**: Notice that $(x + 1)^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}$. This suggests that we can use a pattern to simplify the expression.
3. **Apply the pattern to simplify the expression**: Use the fact that $(x + 1)^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}$ to rewrite $(x + 1)^{2010}$ in a more manageable form.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Use polynomial long division or synthetic division to find the remainder of $(x + 1)^{2010}$ divided by $x^2 + x + 1$**: This will give us an initial expression for the remainder, which we can then simplify.
2. **Notice the pattern of $(x + 1)^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{x^2 + x + 1}$**: We can use this pattern to reduce the exponent $2010$ to a more manageable form, possibly using properties of modular arithmetic.
3. **Apply properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the expression for the remainder**: We can use the fact that if $a \equiv b \pmod{n}$, then $a^c \equiv b^c \pmod{n}$, and possibly other properties to simplify the expression for the remainder.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. Observe that $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$, so we can use polynomial long division or the remainder theorem to relate $(x + 1)^{2010}$ to $x^3 - 1$.
2. Note that $(x + 1)^{2010} = ((x^3 - 1) + 2)^{2010}$, allowing us to rewrite the expression in a form that relates to $x^3 - 1$.
3. Apply a suitable substitution to simplify the expression further, taking advantage of the properties of $x^3 - 1$.
4. Use modular arithmetic to find the remainder when the simplified expression is divided by $x^2 + x + 1$.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost function and its requirements for the domain: $\log_5x$ must have a positive argument, so $x > 0$.
2. Consider the next function in the composition: $\log_4(\log_5x)$ must also have a positive argument, so $\log_5x > 0$, implying $x > 1$.
3. Continue this process for the remaining functions, ensuring each argument is positive, resulting in a sequence of inequalities.
4. Use these inequalities to determine the overall domain of the function $f(x)$.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost logarithmic function $\log_5x$ and determine the condition for it to be defined, which is $x>0$.
2. Work outwards, ensuring that each subsequent logarithmic function has a positive argument, leading to the conditions $\log_4(\log_5x)>0$, $\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x))>0$, and finally $\log_2(\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x)))$ is defined.
3. Solve the inequalities resulting from steps 1 and 2 to find the domain of $f(x)$.
4. Combine the conditions to obtain the final domain of the function $f(x)$.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost logarithmic function and its base, which is $\log_5x$. For this function to be defined, $x$ must be greater than 0, as the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined.
2. The next function to consider is $\log_4(\log_5x)$. Since the argument of a logarithm must be positive, $\log_5x > 0$. This implies that $x > 1$, as the logarithm of 1 is 0.
3. Similarly, for $\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x))$ to be defined, $\log_4(\log_5x) > 0$. This implies that $\log_5x > 1$, which in turn implies that $x > 5$.
4. Finally, for $\log_2(\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x)))$ to be defined, $\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x)) > 0$. This implies that $\log_4(\log_5x) > 1$, which in turn implies that $\log_5x > 4$, and hence $x > 5^4 = 625$.

The domain of the function $f(x)$ is therefore $(625, \infty)$.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost logarithmic function, $\log_5x$, and determine the condition for its argument to be positive, since the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined.

2. Analyze the composition of logarithmic functions and determine the condition for the domain of each subsequent function, ensuring that the output of each function is within the domain of the next function.
3. Apply the condition that the argument of a logarithmic function must be strictly greater than 0, leading to a chain of inequalities for the domain of $f(x)$.
4. Derive the final domain of $f(x)$ by combining the inequalities obtained in the previous steps.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost function $\log_5x$, which must have a positive argument, so $x > 0$.
2. Consider the next function $\log_4(\log_5x)$, which must also have a positive argument, so $\log_5x > 0$, implying $x > 1$.
3. Repeat the process for the remaining functions: $\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x)) > 0$ implies $\log_4(\log_5x) > 1$, which in turn implies $\log_5x > 4$, or $x > 625$.
4. Since all functions must have positive arguments, the domain of $f(x)$ will be the intersection of these conditions, yielding the domain of $f(x)$.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost logarithmic function $\log_5x$ and determine its domain, which requires $x>0$ since the logarithm of a non-positive number is undefined.
2. Apply the same logic to the next nested logarithmic function $\log_4(\log_5x)$, requiring that $\log_5x > 0$, which implies $x>1$.
3. Continue this process for the remaining logarithmic functions, requiring $\log_3(\log_4(\log_5x)) > 0$, which implies $\log_4(\log_5x) > 1$, and subsequently, $\log_5x > 4$.
4. Finally, solve the resulting inequality to find the domain of the entire function $f(x)$.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. Identify the innermost function and determine the condition for its domain, which is $\log_5x > 0$ since the argument of a logarithm must be positive.
2. Use the condition from step 1 to establish a lower bound for $x$.
3. Work outward, iteratively applying the conditions for the domains of the next logarithmic functions.
4. The final condition will provide the domain of the entire function $f(x)$.

2. **Determine the equation of the line through O and A**: Since O is the origin (0,0) and A is (x, y), the slope of the line through O and A is y/x.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that each path can be represented as a sequence of R (right), U (up), and D (diagonal) moves, where the particle always moves to the right or up before moving diagonally.
2. Since the particle never turns right, all diagonal moves must be in the form of RU (right-up) or UR (up-right), which can be simplified to just R or U.
3. Count the number of ways to arrange the remaining R and U moves to reach the final point (5,5), which will involve using combinatorial methods to calculate the number of paths.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Recognize the problem as a combinatorial problem**: The problem can be viewed as finding the number of ways to arrange a sequence of steps that satisfy the given constraints.
2. **Model the problem using a string or sequence**: Represent each step as a character in a string (e.g., "R" for right, "U" for up, and "D" for diagonal). The goal is to find the number of valid strings of length 10 (5 steps in each of the x and y directions).
3. **Identify the constraints on the sequence**: No right angle turns means that each step must be followed by a diagonal step, or no step at all (i.e., a "stay" or "do nothing" step).
4. **Consider a recursive or dynamic programming approach**: Break down the problem into smaller subproblems and use a recursive or dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid paths.
5. **Explore the possibility of using a generating function or other combinatorial technique**: The problem may be amenable to a generating function or other combinatorial technique, such as the "ballot theorem" or "Lagrange inversion formula".

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Consider the total number of steps**: Since the particle can only move in the positive x and y directions, and it must reach (5,5), we know it must take a total of 10 steps to reach the destination.
2. **Introduce a bijection to simplify the problem**: We can create a bijection between paths and sequences of Rs and Us, where R denotes a step in the x-direction and U denotes a step in the y-direction. This is because each path can be uniquely represented by a sequence of Rs and Us.
3. **Determine the number of Rs and Us**: Since the particle starts at (0,0) and must reach (5,5), the number of Rs must be 5 and the number of Us must be 5.
4. **Use combinatorics to count the number of paths**: We can use the combination formula to count the number of ways to arrange 5 Rs and 5 Us in a sequence of 10 steps.
5. **Consider the restriction on right-angle turns**: We must ensure that the sequence of Rs and Us does not contain any right-angle turns. This can be done by considering the sequence as a string of Rs and Us and applying a combinatorial argument to count the number of valid strings.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Recognize the problem as a combinatorial problem**: The problem can be seen as finding the number of paths from (0,0) to (5,5) with certain constraints.
2. **Identify the constraints**: The particle can only move in three directions (right, up, or diagonally right-up) and there are no right angle turns.
3. **Consider the problem as a lattice path problem with diagonal moves**: We can think of the particle's movement as a lattice path with diagonal moves, where each diagonal move represents a "2" in the path.
4. **Find a way to represent the paths as a sequence of moves**: We can represent each path as a sequence of "R" (right), "U" (up), and "D" (diagonal right-up) moves.
5. **Count the number of ways to arrange the moves**: We can use combinatorial techniques to count the number of ways to arrange the moves, taking into account the constraints.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the problem can be modeled using a grid and that the particle's movements can be represented as a sequence of steps, where each step is either a horizontal (H), vertical (V), or diagonal (D) movement.
2. Note that the total number of steps required to reach (5,5) from (0,0) is 10, consisting of 5 horizontal, 5 vertical, and 0 diagonal movements, or other combinations thereof.
3. Consider the problem as a combinatorial problem, where we need to count the number of ways to arrange the steps (H, V, and D) to form valid paths, subject to the constraint that there are no right-angle turns.
4. Develop a recursive or dynamic programming approach to count the number of valid paths, possibly by breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems and using a state variable to keep track of the number of valid paths with a given number of steps.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the problem can be solved using combinatorics and lattice paths.
2. Break down the problem into smaller sub-problems, focusing on the number of ways to reach each intermediate point.
3. Identify that the problem can be solved using a recursive approach or dynamic programming.
4. Consider the constraints that the particle cannot make right angle turns, which affects the possible paths.
5. Develop a method to count the number of paths that satisfy the constraints, such as using a "diagonal" or "non-diagonal" approach to track the particle's movement.
6. Use the insights from the sub-problems to calculate the total number of paths from (0,0) to (5,5).

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that each path can be represented as a sequence of R's (right moves), U's (up moves), and D's (diagonal moves) of length 10, with exactly 5 R's and 5 U's.
2. Observe that since there are no right angle turns, any path must have a unique "diagonalization" pattern, where D's always occur in pairs.
3. Count the number of ways to choose the positions of the D's (diagonal moves) in the sequence of R's and U's.
4. Use combinatorics to count the number of paths corresponding to each unique pattern of D's.
5. Sum up the number of paths corresponding to each pattern to obtain the total number of paths.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Reduce to a combinatorial problem**: Recognize that the particle's movement can be represented as a sequence of steps to the right (R), up (U), or diagonally (D).
2. **Identify the constraints**: Note that the particle cannot take a right angle turn, so each path must be composed of a sequence of steps that do not form a right angle.
3. **Find the sequence length**: Determine that the particle must take 10 steps in total to reach the destination (5 steps to the right, 5 steps up, and 5 steps diagonally, but since the diagonals reduce the total number of steps, we'll need to find the correct balance).
4. **Count the distinct paths**: Use a combinatorial method, such as generating functions or recursion, to count the number of paths that satisfy the constraints.
5. **Simplify and calculate**: Simplify the combinatorial expression and calculate the final answer.

   - Total number of legs: 2A + 4E = 40
3. Simplify the equations to make them more manageable.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

2. **Simplify the equations to make them easier to work with**: Divide the second equation by 2 to get A + 2E = 20.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the problem is about finding the probability of a specific type of binomial distribution, where we have 6 trials (dice rolls) and want to find the probability of an equal number of successes (even numbers) and failures (odd numbers).
2. Identify the probability of success (even number) and failure (odd number) for a single die roll, which is 1/2 for both.
3. Apply the concept of binomial coefficients to count the number of ways to have an equal number of successes and failures, which is the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 dice to show even numbers (and the rest show odd numbers).
4. Calculate the probability of a specific arrangement of 3 even and 3 odd numbers using the probability of success and failure.
5. Use the binomial coefficient and the probability of a specific arrangement to find the total probability of having an equal number of even and odd numbers.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

2. We can treat this as a problem of counting the number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 to show even numbers, and then calculate the probability of this occurring.
3. We will use the binomial coefficient to count the number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6.
4. We will then calculate the probability of the chosen dice showing even numbers and the other dice showing odd numbers.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the possible distributions**: Recognize that the problem is about finding the probability of having an equal number of even and odd numbers, which means 3 even and 3 odd dice.
2. **Count the number of ways to achieve this distribution**: Use combinatorics to count the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 dice to show even numbers, and the remaining 3 to show odd numbers.
3. **Calculate the probability of each outcome**: For each of the combinations counted in step 2, calculate the probability of rolling 3 even and 3 odd numbers.
4. **Sum the probabilities of the desired outcomes**: Add up the probabilities calculated in step 3 to find the total probability of having an equal number of even and odd numbers.

---

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the possible number of even and odd dice**: Since there are 6 dice and we want an equal number of even and odd dice, there are two possibilities: 3 even and 3 odd dice.
2. **Compute the probability of each possibility**: We will need to consider the probability of getting 3 even and 3 odd dice in any order.
3. **Use a combinatorial argument**: We will use combinations to count the number of ways to choose which 3 dice show even numbers (and the remaining 3 show odd numbers).
4. **Calculate the probability of a single die being even or odd**: Each die has a probability of 1/2 of being even or odd.
5. **Apply the binomial probability formula**: We will use the binomial probability formula to calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 even and 3 odd dice.
6. **Simplify the expression**: We will simplify the resulting expression to obtain the final probability.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the problem is about counting the number of ways to have 3 even and 3 odd dice, out of 6 dice.
2. Use combinations to count the number of ways to choose which 3 dice show even numbers (and the remaining 3 show odd numbers).
3. Calculate the probability of getting exactly 3 even numbers and 3 odd numbers, by considering the probability of each die showing an even or odd number, and multiplying these probabilities together for each of the 6 dice.
4. Account for the fact that the order of the dice does not matter, so we need to divide by the number of ways to arrange 3 even and 3 odd dice.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the problem is a binomial probability problem, where each die can be considered a Bernoulli trial with a probability of success (even number) of 1/2.

4. Multiply the number of ways to choose the dice by the probability of each specific outcome to get the total probability of having an equal number of even and odd numbers.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

2. Use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to choose 3 dice out of 6 to be even (and thus the remaining 3 are odd).
3. Calculate the probability of each of these 3 even dice and 3 odd dice occurring.
4. Use the multiplication principle to combine the results of steps 2 and 3 to find the total probability of having 3 even and 3 odd dice.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. **Determine the condition for equality**: The number of dice showing even numbers must be equal to the number of dice showing odd numbers. Since there are 6 dice in total, this means 3 dice must show even numbers and 3 dice must show odd numbers.
2. **Calculate the probability of a single die showing an even or odd number**: Each die has an equal chance of showing an even or odd number, with a probability of 1/2 for each.
3. **Apply the binomial coefficient to count the number of ways to choose 3 out of 6 dice to show even numbers**: This will give us the number of ways to satisfy the condition.
4. **Calculate the probability of the chosen dice showing even numbers and the remaining dice showing odd numbers**: This will involve raising the probability of a single die showing an even or odd number to the power of the number of dice.
5. **Multiply the results from steps 3 and 4 to get the final probability**: This will give us the probability that the number of dice showing even numbers and the number of dice showing odd numbers is equal.

2. Identify the equality condition for the AM-GM inequality, which will give us the value of $n$ that minimizes the expression.
3. Check if the obtained value of $n$ satisfies the condition of being a positive integer.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

2. **Use AM-GM to find a lower bound**: Apply the inequality to the expression $\frac{n}{2} + \frac{18}{n}$ by letting $a = \frac{n}{2}$ and $b = \frac{18}{n}$. This will provide a lower bound on the value of the expression.
3. **Identify the equality condition**: Determine the condition under which the equality holds in the AM-GM inequality, which will give us the value of $n$ that minimizes the expression.
4. **Find the positive integer solution**: Since $n$ must be a positive integer, we will need to find the smallest positive integer that satisfies the equality condition found in the previous step.

3. Apply calculus (or algebraic manipulations) to find the critical points of the expression, which correspond to potential minimum values.
4. Analyze the behavior of the expression around the critical points to determine the global minimum.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. We need to minimize the expression \(\frac{n}{2} + \frac{18}{n}\), which involves a balance between the terms \(\frac{n}{2}\) and \(\frac{18}{n}\).
2. To find the optimal value of \(n\), we can consider using calculus to find the critical points of the expression.
3. However, since we are looking for the minimum value for a positive integer \(n\), we can also consider using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality to find a lower bound on the expression.
4. Applying the AM-GM inequality, we have \(\frac{n}{2} + \frac{18}{n} \geq 2\sqrt{\frac{n}{2} \cdot \frac{18}{n}}\).
5. Simplifying the inequality, we get \(\frac{n}{2} + \frac{18}{n} \geq 2\sqrt{9} = 6\).

5. Calculate the number of times each value of k occurs, which can be done using a simple combinatorial argument.
6. Evaluate the resulting sum over k.

# Example

## Proposal 1

APPROACH:

1. Determine the maximum number of students with only brown eyes, by assuming all 12 students with brown eyes do not have a lunch box.
2. Calculate the remaining number of students without a lunch box, which is 30 - 20 = 10.
3. Subtract this number from the total number of students with brown eyes to find the minimum number of students with both brown eyes and a lunch box.

---

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. Let's first identify the number of students who do not have brown eyes, which is 30 - 12 = 18.
2. Since 20 students have a lunch box, and some of these students may not have brown eyes, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to determine the minimum overlap.
3. We'll consider the maximum number of students who have a lunch box but do not have brown eyes, which is the minimum overlap between the two sets.
4. To find the minimum overlap, we'll aim to maximize the number of students who have a lunch box but not brown eyes, while still satisfying the given conditions.
5. This will involve setting up an equation to represent the relationships between the different groups of students and solving for the minimum overlap.

---

## Proposal 3

APPROACH:

2. **Identify the overlap**: Determine the minimum possible overlap between the brown-eyed students and the students with a lunch box.
3. **Apply the principle of inclusion-exclusion**: Use the formula |A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∪ B|, where |A| is the number of brown-eyed students, |B| is the number of students with a lunch box, and |A ∪ B| is the total number of students with either brown eyes or a lunch box (or both).
4. **Minimize the overlap**: Since we want to find the least possible number of students with both brown eyes and a lunch box, we'll assume the maximum possible number of students without a lunch box or with brown eyes only.
5. **Calculate the minimum overlap**: Using the inclusion-exclusion principle, calculate the minimum possible number of students with both brown eyes and a lunch box.

## Proposal 4

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the total number of students with brown eyes and a lunch box**: Calculate the intersection of the two sets (brown-eyed students and students with a lunch box) by using the principle of inclusion-exclusion.
2. **Minimize the intersection using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion**: Use the formula: |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|, where |A| is the number of brown-eyed students, |B| is the number of students with a lunch box, and |A ∪ B| is the total number of students. Since we want to minimize |A ∩ B|, we will rearrange the formula to solve for |A ∩ B|: |A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∪ B|.
3. **Calculate the least possible number of students with brown eyes and a lunch box**: Plug in the given values: |A| = 12 (brown-eyed students), |B| = 20 (students with a lunch box), and |A ∪ B| = 30 (total number of students). Solve for |A ∩ B| to find the least possible number of students who have brown eyes and a lunch box.

## Proposal 5

2. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the total number of students with either brown eyes or a lunch box: 12 (brown eyes) + 20 (lunch box) - (number of students with both) = 30 (total students).
3. Rearrange the equation to solve for x, the number of students with both brown eyes and a lunch box: x = 12 + 20 - 30 = 2. However, this assumes all 12 students with brown eyes have a lunch box. To find the least possible number, we need to consider the scenario where fewer students with brown eyes have a lunch box.
4. Introduce a variable to represent the number of students with brown eyes who do not have a lunch box, which is 12 - x. Since we want to minimize x, we want to maximize the number of students with brown eyes who do not have a lunch box. In the best-case scenario, all 20 students with a lunch box have brown eyes, so x = 0.
5. Solve for the least possible number of students with brown eyes and a lunch box, which is x = 0.

3. Calculate the number of students with only brown eyes (12) and the number of students with only a lunch box (20 - x), where x is the minimum overlap we are trying to find.
4. Consider the fact that there are only 30 students in the class, and that the sum of the students with only brown eyes, the students with only a lunch box, and the minimum overlap (x) must be less than or equal to 30.

3. Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the maximum number of students with only brown eyes or only a lunch box. This will involve finding the maximum number of students with only brown eyes and the maximum number of students with only a lunch box.
4. Subtract the maximum number of students with only brown eyes and only a lunch box from the total number of students with brown eyes and the total number of students with a lunch box to find the least possible number of students with both brown eyes and a lunch box.

3.  Once we find the GCD, we can determine the smallest positive debt that can be resolved.

## Proposal 4

2. Identify the coefficients of the linear Diophantine equation, where 300p + 210g = d, and d is the amount of debt to be resolved.

5. Express the GCD as a linear combination of 300 and 210, which will provide the smallest positive debt that can be resolved in terms of pigs and goats.

---

## Proposal 5

APPROACH:

1. Let's define the problem in terms of a linear Diophantine equation, where we want to find the smallest positive integer $x$ such that $300a + 210b = x$.
2. To find the solution, we can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 210, and express it as a linear combination of 300 and 210.
3. Once we have the GCD expressed as a linear combination, we can find the smallest positive integer solution to the Diophantine equation.

---

## Proposal 6

APPROACH:

1. Let $p$ be the number of pigs and $g$ be the number of goats exchanged, with the debt being paid from the first farmer to the second.
2. The total value of the debt is $300p + 210g$.
3. Since the first farmer is paying the debt, $300p + 210g \leq 0$, and the second farmer is receiving the debt, $300p + 210g \geq 0$.
4. We need to find the smallest positive value of $300p + 210g$ that satisfies the above inequalities.
5. Consider the system of linear equations $300p + 210g = 0$ and $300p + 210g = x$, where $x$ is the smallest positive debt.
6. Solve for the greatest common divisor (GCD) of $300$ and $210$ to find the smallest positive value of $x$.

---

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. Let $x$ be the amount of the smallest positive debt that can be resolved.
2. We want to find the smallest value of $x$ such that there exist integers $p$ and $g$ satisfying the equation $300p + 210g = x$.
3. We can apply the Chicken McNugget Theorem, which states that the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $ad + bd$ (where $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime) is $ab - a - b$.
4. In this case, we have $a = 300$ and $b = 210$, so the greatest integer that cannot be written in the form $300p + 210g$ is $(300)(210) - 300 - 210$.
5. This will give us an upper bound on the smallest possible value of $x$.
6. We can then check to see if this upper bound can actually be expressed as $300p + 210g$ for some integers $p$ and $g$.
7. If it can, then this value of $x$ is the smallest positive debt that can be resolved.

---

## Proposal 8

APPROACH:

1. Recognize that the problem is essentially finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 300 and 210, since the debt can be resolved if and only if the amount of the debt is a linear combination of 300 and 210.
2. Apply the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 300 and 210.
3. The GCD found in step 2 will be the smallest positive debt that can be resolved.

## Proposal 2

APPROACH:

1. **Reduce the problem to a manageable form**: Consider the problem as finding the number of different routes from $A$ to $B$ using each road exactly once, and allowing cities to be visited more than once. To simplify, we can ignore the direction of the roads and focus on the sequence of cities visited, treating each city as a node and each road as an edge.
2. **Identify the key constraints**: Note that each road can only be used once, and each city can be visited more than once. Also, the problem asks for the number of different routes, not the number of different paths, so we need to consider the order of cities visited.
3. **Apply graph theory concepts**: Recognize that the problem can be modeled as a graph, where cities are vertices and roads are edges. We can use graph theory concepts, such as graph isomorphism, to identify equivalent routes and count the number of distinct routes.
4. **Consider using a combinatorial approach**: Since we need to count the number of different routes, a combinatorial approach may be more suitable than a graph-theoretic one. We can use techniques such as permutations, combinations, and the inclusion-exclusion principle to count the number of distinct routes.
5. **Identify the underlying combinatorial structure**: Once we have a combinatorial approach, we need to identify the underlying combinatorial structure of the problem. This may involve counting the number of ways to choose a subset of cities to visit, or counting the number of ways to arrange a sequence of cities.
6. **Develop a recursive or dynamic programming approach**: Depending on the combinatorial structure, we may need to develop a recursive or dynamic programming approach to count the number of distinct routes. This will involve breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them recursively or using memoization.

	* Removing road $\widetilde{AB}$ from the graph.
	* Considering the number of ways to visit each city more than once.
2. **Apply the "stars and bars" combinatorial method**: Once we have reduced the problem, we can apply the "stars and bars" combinatorial method to count the number of ways to visit each city more than once.

## Proposal 7

APPROACH:

1. **Identify the necessary conditions for a valid route**: A valid route from A to B that uses each road exactly once must necessarily visit some cities more than once. This implies that the route cannot be a simple path and must involve cycles or loops.
2. **Break down the problem into manageable sub-problems**: We can break down the problem into smaller sub-problems by considering the different cycles or loops that can be formed using the roads.
3. **Analyze the cycles and their implications on the route**: For each cycle, we need to determine how it affects the possible routes from A to B. This may involve identifying the number of ways to traverse the cycle and how it interacts with the remaining roads.
4. **Use combinatorial techniques to count the possible routes**: Once we have analyzed the cycles and their implications, we can use combinatorial techniques such as permutations, combinations, and inclusion-exclusion to count the possible routes from A to B.
5. **Consider the use of graph theory and road configurations**: The problem involves a specific road configuration, and we may need to use graph theory to analyze the properties of the graph and how they affect the possible routes.
