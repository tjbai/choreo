Then $U_1=4$, $U_2=7$, and by definition, the remainder modulo $10$ of the $n$-th term when $n>2$ is the units digit of the sum of the two previous terms, $U_{n-1}$ and $U_{n-2}.$  Using induction, it follows that the remainder modulo $10$ of $S_n$ is the units digit of the remainder modulo $10$ of the sum of the first $n$ terms of the sequence.  We want to know when this units digit exceeds $10,000.$\nThe units digit of the sum of the first $n$ terms repeats with a period of $10 .$  This is because the remainder modulo $10$ of the $m$-th term and the $m+10$-th term have the same remainder modulo $10 .$  Assume, by contradiction, that the first such $n$ is even.  Then the sequence of units digits modulo $10$ in the first six terms of the sequence must repeat.  Since $4+7=11$ is an odd multiple of $11 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10},$ we must have that $U_6 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{10}.$ Noting that $11,21,91,11 \\equiv (11)(1)$ on modulo $10,$ then $U_{11},$ by definition, lies between $1$ and $9$ inclusive finding the opposite result since  $U_7,U_8, U_9$ gotta be >9, finish proof", "Answer:  $\\boxed{\\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{3}}$.\n \nExplanation: To solve for $\\sin L$, we can use the law of sines.

Since $f(x)$ has domain $(-\\infty,\\infty)$, any positive value of $6x$ is also in the domain of $f$.\n(b) Furthermore, since values of the form $6x$ grow quite rapidly, we might expect that they would eventually go outside the range $[-11,3]$ of $f$.  So we begin by letting $y$ be a number in the range of $f$, and letting $z=y+1$ be a corresponding number in the range of $g$. Then since the range of $f$ is $[-11,3]$, we have $-11\\le y\\le 3.$\n(c) So to establish the range of $g$, we just need to determine the values that $z=y+1$ can take in this case.

Each has at least one card and some black cards and red cards. \\\\\n\nThe number of red cards in pile A is $\\frac{R_A}{6}$, so the number of black cards in pile A is $6\\cdot R_A.$ \\\\\n\nThe number of red cards in pile B is $R_B$ and the number of black cards is $\\frac{R_B}{k}$ for some positive integer $k$. \\\\\n\nSince each pile has at least one card, the number of red cards plus the number of black cards in each pile is either 27.

So this is not a solution. The same problem arises in Pile B when we have the number of black cards as a fraction. Since the pattern of the equations arises from what we haven't ruled out in the case of Pile A, we can rule out that in Pile B. Dually with Pile A we cannot split the red cards in Pile B. So we get...\n$6\\cdot R_A + R_B = 26$\n\nNow, we have given that the number of red cards in pile B is $R_B$. Similarly, for pile A we had $6\\cdot R_B$, but in the case of Pile A we didn't have a multiple-sized pile for a long time.

To solve for $x$, we need to get rid of the fraction and the $x$ in the denominator by multiplying both sides of the equation by the denominator. This gives us $x(a+xa)$. Rearranging the terms, we get $a(a-1)x=1-x^{2}$. Then we need to factor the right-hand side of the equation to complete the square. Recall the identity $x^{2}-y^{2}=(x+y)(x-y)$. It follows that $1-x^{2}=(1-x)(1+x)$. Letting $y=(1-x)$, the square is $y^{2}=x^{2}-2x+1$ and $y(x+y)=x(xy)$. Combining everything, we get $(a-1)y^{2}+[2a+(a-1)x]y=a(a-1)x$. The second term, $2ax+a^{2}$, is what we needed to find. The steps required to associate the second term with the functions $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are negligible compared to the steps required to solve the equation, so we be continual.\n\nSubstitute $y=(1-x)$ into the equation $a(a+xa)=1-x^{2}$ to get $a(a-1)(1-x)^{2}=1-x^{2}$.

Substituting in for $f(x_1)$ we find\n\\[ g(x) = f(f(x_1)) = \\frac{1}{2(x) -5} \\]\nSimilarly, we find the composite function starting from  $f(x_1)=x_1$\n\\[ g(x_1) = f(f(x_1)) = \\frac{1}{2(f(x_1)) - 5} = \\frac{1}{2(\\frac{1}{2x_1-5})-5} \\]\nIn order to solve this equation, first combine the fractions by finding a common denominator \n\\[ g(x_1) = \\frac{1}{\\frac{2\\cdot\\frac{1}{2x_1-5} - 5}{1}} \\]\nDon't let the fact that one fraction is INTEGERS and the other fraction is a function fool you.

These two expressions are equal to zero when $x=3$ and $x=-3$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, there are 2 values of $x$ for which the expression $\\frac{x-5}{x^2-9}$ is undefined.", "Answer: 36\nStep 1: First, we need to understand the given problem and the geometric configuration involved in it.  We are given a triangle ABC with an incircle that touches the sides BC, AC, and AB at points D, E, and F, respectively.  We are asked to find the measure of angle EDF in degrees.\nStep 2: The problem involves understanding the relationship between the angle bisector, the incircle, and the vertices of the triangle. We need to leverage this understanding to determine the measure of angle EDF.\nStep 3: Let's first consider the properties of the incircle and its relation to the vertices of the triangle. The incircle is the largest circle that can be drawn within the triangle, and its center is called the incenter.\nStep 4: The incenter of a triangle is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. Since the incircle touches the sides of the triangle at points D, E, and F, the line segments BD, CE, and AF are radii of the incircle and therefore equal in length.\nStep 5: Now, let's examine the relationship between the lines BE and ED. Since BE is the angle bisector of angle BAC and ED is a segment between the incenter and one of the triangle's sides, we can deduce that angle EDF is half the measure of angle BAC.\nStep 6: Given that angle BAC is 72 degrees, we can calculate angle EDF.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{36}$", "Answer:  \\frac{35}{}\\mathbf{4}", "Answer: 18\n\nThe ratio 1 to 11 and 4 to 9 both have common multiples with a denominator of 9.  Therefore, we can restate the ratios as 3 to 33, so there are 33 parts in all.  The number of female students is 32 out of 33.

This is not equal to 4280, so we know that 1176 is not equal to 4280 and that there must be more students in the school.\n\n FROM PART I OF THE PROBLEM We know that the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. That is, for every 1 teacher, there are 11 students. We also know FROM PART II OF THE PROBLEM that the ratio of female students to total number of students is 4 to 9. That is, for every 4 female students, there are 9 total students. Since we know that the total number of female students is 396, we can set up the following equation:\n\n  39     1292 =  24\n  9 geschichten= \u00d79+1 =  \u22483805+1\nWhich is close to 4280.

FROM PART I OF THE PROBLEM, we know that the ratio of teachers to students is 1 to 11. To find the total number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by 11. \n\n= 4280 \u00f7 11 = 388.1818 \n\nSince you can't have a fraction of a teacher, we must round the number to the nearest whole number.

The dot product is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors times the cosine of the angle between them.\n\nSteps to solve the problem:\n\n1. Write down the equation for the dot product of the given vectors.\n2. Write down the equation for the magnitude of each vector.\n3. Express the dot product as a function of the magnitudes and the cosine of the angle.\n4. Manipulate the equation to find an expression for the cosine of the angle.\n5. Find the maximum value of the cosine of the angle, which corresponds to the maximum angle between the vectors.\n\nDerivation\nWe can use the dot product to find the angle between the two vectors. The dot product is defined as the sum of the products of the corresponding components of the two vectors. Let $\\mathbf{u} = \\begin{pmatrix} a \\\\ b \\\\ c \\end{pmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{v} = \\begin{pmatrix} b \\\\ c \\\\ a \\end{pmatrix}$.\n\nThe dot product of the two vectors is\n\n$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = ab + bc + ca.$\n\nWe also know that the dot product is equal to the product of the magnitudes of the two vectors times the cosine of the angle between them:\n\n$\\mathbf{u}\\cdot\\mathbf{v} = ||\\mathbf{u}||\\,||\\mathbf{v}||\\cos\\theta.$$\n\nwhere $||\\mathbf{u}||$ and $||\\mathbf{v}||$ are the magnitudes of the vectors and $\\theta$ is the angle between them. \n\nThe magnitude of each vector can be found as: \n\n$||\\mathbf{u}|| = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$ \n\n$||\\mathbf{v}|| = \\sqrt{b^2 + c^2 + a^2}$.\n\nThe final result for the maximum angle is 120 degrees.", "Answer: 80\n\nThis problem is relatively hard since it requires thorough understanding of decimals and the prime factorization of a number. First, we must realize that the decimal representation of a fraction terminates if and only if the denominator when simplified is in the form $2^m5^n$ where $m$ and $n$ are nonnegative integers. So, we must prime factorize 1375 and get\n\n1375 $ = $ 5^2 \\mbox{\\hspace{5pt}} \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\cdot$}\\hspace{5pt} 5 \\mbox{\\hspace{5pt}} \\mbox{\\boldmath$\\cdot$}\\hspace{5pt} 7.\n\nSo, the fraction n /1375 terminates if and only if n is divisible by 7 but not by 5. Since half the numbers from 1 to 1000 are divisible by 5, half the numbers from 1 to 1000 are divisible by 7. Since we are only counting integers from 1 to 1000 inclusive, we have 142 numbers that are divisible by 7.

We know that the only possible values for a die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For the first die, there are the possibilities 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The other 4 dice are 5-sided dice, and each of their possible outcomes is only 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since there are only the 5 possible values for each of the 4 dice, we know the number of outcomes for all 4 dice is equal to 5^4 or 625. Now we can calculate the total number of outcomes for the original problem, which is equal to 6^5or 7776. Now that we have the total number of outcomes where no 1 is shown and the total number of outcomes, we can count the outcomes where no more than four dice show a 1. To do this, we can count the outcomes where random number of dice show a 1 variable between 0 and 4, inclusive, where no more than four dice show a 1. We can use this process to count the total outcome.\n\nTo count the number of outcomes where 0 dice show a 1, we have 4 dice that are each 5 sided dice. Among the 5 possible values, there are the values 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. since the dice is each 5-sided dice, we know that there are 5 diffrent possibilities and it follows that the total outcomes where we get the favorable roll, i.e. 0, is equal to the multiplication of these five number\u2019s possibilities which is 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 = 625.\n\nNow we can calculate the number of outcomes where no more than right number of 1 shown but one die doesn\u2019t show a 1. to do this, it is not easy to calculate 5-sided dice is just right with dice-number of die-side, in the right roll. However, maybe we need to go to next possibilities. To get our result right, the first 4 dice show a 1, and the other (which we correctly got to be 1) dice is right pick from 5 number.

Let the width of the original garden be w. The length is twice the width, so it is 2w.\n2. The perimeter of the original garden is 2w + 2(2w) = 6w.\n3. The perimeter is doubled, so the new perimeter is 6w + 6w = 12w.\n4. The new shape is a square with side length x. The perimeter is 12w = 4x. So, x = 3w.\n5. The area of the square is x^2 = (3w)^2 = 9w^2.\n6. The area is 3600 square feet, so 9w^2 = 3600.\n7. Taking the square root of both sides, we get w^2 = 400.\n8. Taking the square root of both sides, we get w = 20.\n9. Now, we can find the area of the original garden: Area = w * 2w = 20 * 2(20) = 800 sq. ft.\n  No, that is not the answer.

The integer $n$ can be expressed in two different base systems: $4\\triangle_9$ and $\\triangle0_7$, where $\\triangle$ represents a single digit. This means that $n$ can be written as the product of the base and the digit in that base.\n\nTo find the value of $n$, we need to solve the two expressions for $n$ and equate them. Therefore, we can write $4\\triangle_9$ as $4 \\cdot 9^1 + \\triangle \\cdot 9^0$, which simplifies to $36 + \\triangle$. Similarly, we can write $\\triangle0_7$ as $\\triangle \\cdot 7^1 + 0 \\cdot 7^0$, which simplifies to $7\\triangle$. By setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get $$36+\\triangle=7\\triangle.$$\n\nTo solve for $\\triangle$, we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. By subtracting $\\triangle$ from both sides of the equation, we get $$36=6\\triangle.$$ Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for $\\triangle$. Doing exactly that gives us $$n_{\\triangle}=\\boxed{6}.$$\n\nNow, we need to substitute the value of $\\triangle$ into the expressions for the two different bases. We can do this to find the value of $n_1$ and $n_2$, which is the value of the original base ten number. Because $n=4\\triangle_9$, nue = $n_1=4 \\cdot 9^1 + 6 \\cdot 9^0 = 36+6=\\boxed{42}.$\n\nOn the other hand, because $n=\\triangle0_7$, $n_2=7 \\cdot 6^1+0 \\cdot 7^0=\\boxed{42}.$\n\nOf course, that last statement doesn't make sense; we can check that $4\\triangle_9$ is equal to $36+6=42$. But notice that $6 \\cdot 9^0 = 6$, therefore that statement makes perfect sense.\n\nBefore we go on to the next problem, note the entire sequence of steps we used to solve the base-one problem.

The distance between the centers of the two spheres is given by the formula $AB=\\sqrt{(x_{2}-x_{1})^{2}+(y_{2}-y_{1})^{2}+(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}$, so we have\n\n$$AB=\\sqrt{(0-3)^{2}+(1-(-5))^{2}+(1-7)^{2}}=\\sqrt{9+36+36}=\\sqrt{81}=9.$$\n\nThe distance between the two centers is equal to the sum of the radii of the two spheres, minus the radius of the circle of intersection.

We first need to find the semi-perimeter of the triangle, which is half of the sum of the side lengths of the triangle. The side lengths are 7, 24, and 25. So, the semi-perimeter s is calculated as s = (7 + 24 + 25) / 2 = 28.\n\n## Step 2: Use Heron's formula to find the area of the triangle\nHeron's formula is used to find the area of a triangle when given the side lengths. It is calculated as A = sqrt(s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)), where a, b, and c are the side lengths of the triangle and s is the semi-perimeter. Substituting the values we have, A = sqrt(28(28 - 7)(28 - 24)(28 - 25)) = sqrt(28 * 21 * 4 * 3) = sqrt(7056) = 84.\n\n## Step 3: Find the length of the altitude to the base with length 7\nThe area A of a triangle is given by A = (base * height) / 2. We can rearrange this formula to solve for the height, which in this case is the altitude. The altitude h with respect to a side of length 7 can be found as h = (2 * A) / base. Substituting the values we have, h = (2 * 84) / 7 = 24.\n\n## Step 4: Find the length of the altitude to the base with length 24\nSimilarly, we can find the altitude h1 with respect to a side of length 24 using the area of the triangle and the length of the base (since the area remains the same for the same triangle). However, with the side lengths given, the simplest method to find the altitude lengths given the triangle is a right triangle (7, 24, 25 is a Pythagorean triple) is to use the Pythagorean theorem directly and simple geometric reasoning.\n\n## Step 5: Interpret the triangle as a Pythagorean triple\nGiven the sides 7, 24, and 25,", "Answer: 4\n\nThe problem can be read as three tasks occurring in succession\nwe must first convert 80 percent into a numerical value translate the second task, to say the value of 50 percent of eighty 0-point-8\nFinally multiply 20 percent of 0-point-8 with 10, giving 0-point-16 as the numerical value of 20 percent of 80 percent of 80.\nWrapping the whole problem into a single fraction:\n0-point-2, we find that the solution is simply 0-point-16", "Answer: 5\n\nWe can write the equation to solve this problem using the properties of an arithmetic sequence.

Taking the logarithm base 10 of the denominator yields 2x, which must be an integer between 0 and 3. In other words, the value of x that yields a terminating decimal for k cannot be 2. For instance, substituting 3 for x, we get 2 * 3 = 6; dividing 1 by 7 yields 1/7. Therefore, 1/7 is a possible value of k and 7 is a value for the denominator. For instance, substituting 4 for x, we get 2 * 4 = 8; dividing 1 by 9 yields 1/9. Therefore, 1/9 is a possible value of k and 9 is a value for the denominator. In other words, possible values for x are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 0, and 18; in other words, possible values for the denominator of k are 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 do not work.

So our first piece of information is that we have $200$ students, and $126$ of them are taking history, and $129$ of them are taking science. Our second piece of information is that all students are taking one or the other, so adding the two numbers 126 and 129 should equal the total number of students $200$ minus the number of students in both classes.\n So, we can write the equation 129+126-x=200, where x is the number of students that are taking both classes.\n Solve for x: 255-129-126=200-x\n  0=200-x\n  x=200\n x=126+129-200=55.

Then if $3 | \\underline{6}\\underline{3}$, the division algorithm says that there are numbers $k$ and $r$ so that $\\underline{6}\\underline{3} = 3p + r$ where either $r = 0$ or $0 \\le r < 3$. Thus, we can just throw away the cases when $0 \\le r < 3$ to find that all numbers of the form $\\underline{6}\\underline{3}$ are of the form $9+30a$ for integers $a$. Then from this, we can wrestle and pull some incorrect results out to get 93. So going back to our iteration, we see 6|93 and 3|93, so 3 | 93.\nThus, $\\underline{6}\\underline{3}$ is divisible by 3. Similarly we can compute $2\\revert \\underline{6}\\underline{2}$, that is $6 \\not\\equiv 0 \\mod 2$ so $\\underline{6}\\underline{2}$ is not divisible by 2.

To apply this approach, you'll need to recognize that both terms have a common factor, which is $x$. The coefficient of $x$ in the first term is 2, and the coefficient of $x$ in the second term is $-3$. The common factored term is obtained by multiplying the coefficient of the common factor $x$ in the two terms, which is $(2) \\times (-3) = -6$.We then distribute to the terms on the left-hand side of the equation, giving us $-6x+5x-15$. The next step is to combine the like terms in the expression $-6x+5x-15$, where the like terms are the terms containing $x$. When adding $-6x$ and $5x$, we have $(-6x)+(5x)=(-1x)+(5x)$, so $-6x+5x=-x$. When adding 5 and -15, we have $5+(-15) = (5)+(-15)$. Combining $-x$ and, we get $-16 = -6x+5x-15$, which can be simplified as $-16 = (2x)+(-3x)-15$.The quantity $(2x)+(-3x)$ is a combination of a term containing $x$ and the number 0. Any rational expression can be factored by moving one of the terms across a fraction bar. Maintain the leading signs while adding the terms in the second grouping: -16 = 2x - 15, and we have the resulting equation, -16 = -16: 2x - 15 = -16. Adding 15 to both sides of the equation yields 2x = -1xAdding 1x to both sides of the equation, we get 2x+1x=-1x+1x. In the expression, the like termsare the terms that contain x, the left-hand side becomes 3x, and the right-hand side becomes 0. Factoringout the term 2x from the left-hand side and the term -1x from the right-hand side, we get 3x added to 0, or 3x.", "Answer: 6\n\nWe can write the integer $9$ as a linear combination of the numbers $1, $2,$ and $4$ in the following ways: \\begin{align*}\n9 &amp;= 9(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 4(2\\text{'s}) + 1(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 3(2\\text{'s}) + 3(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 2(2\\text{'s}) + 5(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 1(2\\text{'s}) + 7(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 7(1\\text{'s}) + 1(4\\text{'s}) + 1(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 7(1\\text{'s}) + 1(2\\text{'s}) + 2(1\\text{'s})\\\\\n9 &amp;= 1(4\\text{'s}) + 1(2\\text{'s}) + 3(1\\text{'s})\n\\end{align*}Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{6}.$", "Answer: 32\n\nSince the equation contains the absolute value symbol, we must find the possible values of x, then multiply them by each other.\n\nLet's first write down the equation.\n\n|x-4|-10=2\n\nNow, isolate the absolute value.\n\n|x-4|=12\n\nNow, we split it into two equations.\n\nx-4=12\n\nx-4=-12\n\nSolve both equations.\n\nx=16\n\nx=-8\n\nNow, multiply both values by each other to get the product.", "Answer: 0.73", "Answer: 10\n\nThere are two parts to this problem.

The distance between (-1,0) and (2,4) can be calculated using the distance formula: \u221a((2-(-1))^2 + (4-0)^2) = \u221a(3^2 + 4^2) = 5. The distance between (-1,0) and (0,-8) can be calculated using the distance formula: \u221a((0-(-1))^2 + (-8-0)^2) = \u221a(1^2 + 64^2) = \u221a4167 = 64.57 (approximately). The distance between (2,4) and (2,-4) can be calculated using the distance formula: \u221a((2-2)^2 + (-4-4)^2) = \u221a(0^2 + (-8)^2) = 8. The distance between (0,-8) and (2,-4) can be calculated using the distance formula: \u221a((2-0)^2 + (-4-(-8))^2) = \u221a(2^2 + 4^2) = \u221a20 = 4.47 (approximately).\n\n## Step 3: Determine the least and greatest possible perimeters\nThe least possible perimeter occurs when we use the shorter sides for opposite pairs of sides. In this case, we choose the sides with lengths 8 and 5. The greatest possible perimeter occurs when we use the longer sides for opposite", "Answer: 30\n\n## Step 1:  Let's denote the length of Runner A's portion as \\(a\\) miles, and the length of Runner B's portion as \\(b\\) miles.\n## Step 2:  We're given that Runner B's portion is \\(1.5\\) times the length of Runner A's portion, so we have the equation \\(b = 1.5a\\).\n## Step 3:  The combined portion for Runners C and D is twice the length of the combined portion for Runners A and B. Let's denote the portion for Runner C as \\(c\\) and for Runner D as \\(d\\). Therefore, we have the equation \\(c + d = 2(a + b)\\).\n## Step 4:  We also know that the total length of the race is 100 miles, and runners A, B, C, D, and E run separate portions adding up to that total. Therefore, we have the equation \\(a + b + c + d + 10 = 100\\), since Runner E runs the last 10 miles.\n## Step 5:  We can substitute the relationships given in Steps 2 and 3 into our equations to solve for the values of each runner's portion and the length that Runner B has run.\n## Step 6:  First, from Step 2, we have \\(b = 1.5a\\).\n## Step 7:  To use the relationship from Step 3 in our solution, we must substitute the expression for \\(b\\) from Step 6 into \\(c + d = 2(a + b)\\), which gives us \\(c + d = 2(a + 1.5a)\\).\n## Step 8:  Simplifying the expression in Step 7, we have \\(c + d = 2(2.5a)\\), which reduces to \\(c + d = 5a\\).\n## Step 9:  Now we have a system of equations: \\(a + b + c + d + 10 = 100\\) and \\(c + d = 5a\\) and \\(b = 1.5a\\).\n## Step 10:  We can use the second and third equations to simplify the first equation.\n## Step 11:  By substituting the third equation into the first, we get \\(a + 1.5a + c + d + 10 = 100\\).\n## Step 12:", "Answer: 3\n\nSince the sequence is an arithmetic sequence, the common difference between each of the numbers is -23, or:\nd = 987 -1000 = -13\nd = 974-987= -13\nd = 961-974 = -13\nThe first term of the sequence is 1000.

When $n$ is positive, we find that the fraction evaluates to $\\frac{n+1}{13-n} = \\frac{n}{13-n} + \\frac{1}{13-n}.$ Notice that this number will never be an integer for $n$ positive, since dividing by $13-n$ does not eliminate the fraction, and this value is then clearly greater than 1.

This means that $$x^2+25x+c=x^2+2bx+b^2.$$We know that $x^2+25x+c$ is equal to the square of a binomial. This means that $x^2+25x+c$ is equal to the expansion of $(x+b)^2$, or $x^2+2bx+b^2$.

However, since order does not matter here (we do not care what p and q are, but rather what values $m$ and $n$ take on), we need to divide the number of ordered pairs of $(p,q)$ by two. There you go $162/2=81$ possible ways to solve for (p,q), and p and q aren't necessarily distinct, so it could be either a (p,q), (q,p).

Since there are five digits, there are 5! = 120 possible ways to arrange them.\n\nNext, let's consider the divisibility rule for 11. A number is divisible by 11 if and only if the difference between the sum of its even digits and the sum of its odd digits is a multiple of 11. In this case, the difference is 3 - 5 = -2, which is not a multiple of 11.\n\nHowever, we can still try to find a way to make the number divisible by 11 by rearranging the digits. Note that there are 5 = 2 \u00d7 2 + 1 possible carries, and 2 of them can be availed to change the difference into a multiple of 11.\n\nHow can we do this? We want to make the difference between the sum of the even digits and the sum of the odd digits a multiple of 11. Since there are 2 even digits (2 and 4) and 3 odd digits (3, 7, and 8), we need to make the difference between the sum of the even digits and the sum of the odd digits 2. Luckily, we can do this by rearranging the digits. If we place 2, 4, 7, and 8, then 6 would be place between 2 and 8, and erson would be 13 which is not divisible by 11.\n\nIf we then consider the implementation of the 3rd possible carry. By using a digit like +3 we will get the sum difference 5 which is not a multiple of 11.\n\nSince we successfully implemented 2 out of 5 possible digits pairs, in 2^5 = 32 cases we will have 11 difference number, while rest of the possible cases are either 0 difference, or +33 difference, which in both the cases we wont be able to get numbers divisible by 11.\n\nHence, out of the 120 possible arrangements we will have 32 numbers divisible by 11, giving us a probability of 32/120, which simplifies to 1/9.", "Answer: 38,219", "Answer:  $\\boxed{-5}$\nStep 1:  The given expression involves finding the square root of $23$ and then taking the ceiling of that value, which means rounding up to the nearest whole number.

If you create a rectangle that is made up of 4x8 matrices and rotate that so the side of length 8 is up, you get 4x8 matrix.

Setting the broader part of rectangle 1 in front of integer the smaller part of rectangle 2 results in an 8x2 = 16 matrix, so if we multiply the area of the 2 matrices together, we get (32 * 8)/ (32 * 4) = (32 * 2)/ (32 * 4) = (2 * 32) / (4 * 32) = 2/ 4 or in simplest form--1/2. \nThe next step is cannot be overlooked and if overlooked, the great amounts of the math before makes them  completely perplexing.

In the graph, the y-intercept is the point where the graph intersects the y-axis, which is at x=0. So, we must consider only the value of P(0)^2, not the value of Q(0).\n\nStep 3: Evaluate Q(x) = P(x)^2 at x=0\nWe have already evaluated P(x) at x=0 and found that P(0)=-1.

It follows then that $C$ is located at $(-4, -2)$ and $D$ is located at $(0, 0)$. By symmetry, since $\\triangle ABC$ is an equilateral triangle, point $B$ is located at one of the intersections of the line passing through $A = (4, 2)$ with the parabola $x^2 = 8y$. We solve this equation as follows:\n\n\ncmd=\\\";\n\ndefined as\n\nx^2 = 8y\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e23.\n\n\n\\frac{1}{2} x = 2\n\nx = 4\n\n\nwhich are the coordinates of $A$. So, since all three vertices of the triangle have the same $x$-coordinate we know that all three vertices of the triangle lie on the line $x = 4$. Since $B = (4, b)$ is located on the parabola $x^2 = 8y$, we know that $b = \\frac{x^2}{8} = \\frac{16}{8} = 2$.
